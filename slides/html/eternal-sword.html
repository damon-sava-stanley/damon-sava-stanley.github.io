<h1>Init</h1>
<p>You are a dwarf, feeling for the first time the heat of the double suns on your calcified arms, or you are a halfling, treacherous and dark, or you are an elf (and what is your name?), or you are a man from the south, robust and from the south, and the cruel sorcerer St!an has burned your family alive, the cruel sorcerer St!an has torched your village and burned your family alive, the cruel sorcerer St!an has become a dragon and burned your village down, your family, in the last throes of life, thrusting their arms into the smoky sky. You will kill the cruel sorcerer St!an with the Eternal Sword of Q’forr.</p>
<p>You will not kill the cruel sorcerer who is a dragon because he plunged his dark talons into the dark loam and blew fire into the dark sky, each house, their straw roofs, their wooden beams, even the stone themselves glowing red and glowing white and cracking and crackling and the whole dark sky growing darker and hard to breathe and mother and mother and mother, but for the elf princess Ssssss, the elf princess Ssssss who the cruel sorcerer took for himself, the elf princess Ssssss who has come to you in your dreams.</p>
<p>She has come to you in your dreams and with her soft fingers held your hard scales (you are a kobold, morose and lonely) and whispered, soft, that you will kill the dragon who is a cruel sorcerer. There is a sword that is the Eternal Sword of Q’forr.</p>

<h1>Dream</h1>
<p>You continue to dream, the fires never quite going out. The elf princes Ssssss has drawn you in closer, has held with her soft fingers the roughest parts of your fur (you are a kobold, morose and lonely), and she has begun to kiss you with the face of your father. In the space provided, draw the face of your father.</p>
<pre><code>








</code></pre>
<p>You cannot stay sleeping; in the space provided you have drawn all four faces of your father and can no longer tell which one is rubbing its tongue up your cheek. You will now wake up.</p>
</section>
<section id="wake" class="slide level1">
<h1>Wake</h1>
<p>You are awake, all three suns bright above, it must be at least the second midday. Your back aches, your face is covered with soot and cheeks still raw from crying. Perhaps you are far enough away to be safe. The jays seem to think so, whistling something jolly. Or perhaps they are bluebirds, you never listened to what Adze used to tell you; you wish you had. He’s dead now, almost certainly. And mother. And dad. <em>If you do not push yourself out of this grass this moment, you will never get up.</em></p>
<p>And so you do, a vague commitment to living overcoming whatever sense you had. You push yourself up and, in a sudden rush of blood, remember your dream. Checking your inventory, you do not find any swords of Q’forr, eternal or otherwise. You do find</p>
<ul>
<li>two silver and five copper pieces,</li>
<li>a loaf of bread, and</li>
<li>a lock of rich, black hair.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Perhaps you shoud write this down.</em> You should leave. There is nothing more for you here.</p>

<h1>Dead End</h1>
<p>Convention dictates that when you are permitted to press a link, you must press a link. The sky is full of ashes and you are thinking of home. You will start crying in a moment if you do not stop yourself — you cannot make a house of bones. Recognizing the sensibility of this advice, the sky is full of ravens and you are poised to begin making progress. You must make a sign of it: the sky is full of ravens and the dueling suns imbue everything with an unvoicable urgency. Perhaps you can just get back on with it, no need to make a big to do, a brief detour at most and now onwards ho! This will not work, a sacrifice must be made. You reach into your inventory.</p>
<p><em>Release the hair to the wind. Forget someone dear to you.</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/north"><em>Go north.</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes.</p>
</section>
<section id="north" class="slide level1">
<h1>North</h1>
<p>There are three bandits on the road through the woods, each one a worshipper of a different sun. They look at you with a vague hunger; it is clear you have nothing worth taking, but that may not stop them. The largest one, a troll, grey and naked is leaning up against a fir. His ritual scars are fresh and, as he rubs his body against the bark, begin to bleed. You are a troll, too, and not having a good time of it: you know in any other circumstance one of you would kill the other.</p>
<p>But perhaps this is one of those circumstances. The one who may be a man, wrapped in red and pink robes, introduces themselves between you, “Easy there.” But his voice betrays neither certainty nor eagerness, indeed perhaps just an edge of malice, and the orc woman just sharpening her mace.</p>
<p>He is already half bloody; you can almost taste the salt. The third sun is beginning to set.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/conversation">Calm down. Just talk.</a></li>
<li><a href="#/killing">You can almost taste the salt.</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conversation" class="slide level1">
<h1>Conversation</h1>
<p>You throw your shoulders down and mumble out an apology. The orc sidles up to you; this is the end, you think. A cold steel, touch on your back — this is the end, you think. But the metal just stays, slowly warming to something tolerable and you realize she has half embraced you. “Tell me where you’re from,” she says. You gesture towards the fire and she understands; she has always understood you — it is said that orcs can read each other’s thoughts.</p>
<p>You hear the mace clatter to the ground as she pulls you into her shoulder. After a few moments you realize that you are crying. She lowers you to the ground and the other two gather on logs around you. You start explaining what happened. “And the princess,” the man in the robes asks, “have you seen her?”</p>
<p>You insist you have not. The troll lowers his head to the ground. “What about your dreams?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” you say. “Yes.”</p>
<p>And he replies, “We’ve all had those.”</p>
<p>The trio give you hugs and a pin of friendship when they eventually send you on your way. <em>Put it in your inventory.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/ferry">Keep going north.</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="killing" class="slide level1">
<h1>Killing</h1>
<p>They were weaker than you thought. All of the troll’s scars have opened up and the ground has turned purple. The orc woman is impaled on the hilt of her own mace and the robes have been torn away from the man’s face. Everything has gone quiet — the birds now avoid this place.</p>
<p>In the melee, someone dropped a friendship pin (<em>perhaps you</em>) that is now covered with blood. <em>Pick it up. Remember what you have done.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/ferry">Keep going north.</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ferry" class="slide level1">
<h1>Ferry</h1>
<p>The ferry-docks are empty. A fairy standing against the wall to the ferry-hut eyes you, caught up in the design of your <em>Trauggge and the Thornne Maidens</em> tattoo. He is not hard to read.</p>
<p>“The other refugees came and left this morning. I don’t expect I’ll see one of my boats till nighttime, if any of them make it back at all.”</p>
<p>You nod at him, but pause for a moment, your legs grown heavy. But you cannot stop; there is a town behind you that is a smoldering ember and a dragon ahead. He is still watching you, a little closer than you might like. “If you want, you could come inside until they come back.”</p>
<p>You approach slowly, with a nervousness you cannot quite explain. He is young, though you cannot quite place it; as you close in he puts a finger to your chest. “Cool, mate,” he smiles, “I went to see them in the capital with my, with a friend.”</p>
<p>You manage to return the smile. The grey circles beneath his eyes, the flits of worry, it cannot have just been your village.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/inside">Accept the offer.</a></li>
<li><a href="#/river">Don’t you have a princess to save?</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="inside" class="slide level1">
<h1>Inside</h1>
<p>The house goes right down to the river and is bright inside, each window open to a different sun. “I’m afraid the earlier group basically clean house. I cannot imagine what we’re going to do when the next group arrives. When my uncle left today — he owns the place, I’m just here for the season — some of the rafts were so weighted down. I’d be surprised. Well, I don’t like to think about it.” You can hear his voice from another room. “I did manage to find a spot of honey for the tea.”</p>
<p><em>If you want, share your bread with him. Write his response in the blank space.</em></p>
<pre><code>
</code></pre>
<p>Things keep coming back to you in flashes, but clutching the tea you are for a moment calm. You study him as he sits down, his embroidered shirt that cloaks the wings and guages through his ears speak to his time in the city, but his pose, arms thrown over the back of the chair, reveal him as a easterner like yourself. “You travelled alone?” He tenses up as he asks this, sure that he is hitting a nerve.</p>
<p>And maybe he did. Anyways, you do not respond; you cannot say precisely how you feel — not everything is yet ash. “There are a couple of beds in the other room.” He indicates. He has stopped looking at you in quite that way.</p>
<p>A strong breeze blows north, carrying the deep scent of fire throughout the house. You follow him to the other room and collapse. His hands linger at your chest as he throws a blanket over you. Like spiders, you ignore them.</p>
<p>The fire may get here before the boats.</p>
</section>
<section id="fire-and-boats" class="slide level1">
<h1>The Fire and the Boats</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]here we shall see men that by the world were cut in pieces, burnt in flames, eaten of beasts, drowned in the seas, for the love that they bare to the Lord of the place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You start to more fire, more screaming. You grip the bed to check that you have indeed woken. Smoke is again filling the room, but lightly; it does not seem that the house is on fire. You dash outside. It is night, and the forest sways, dark and menacing, under a heavy wind. You turn: the river is on fire. Or rather, the river is filled with boats, and the boats are on fire.</p>
<p>They are far off, a quarter mile perhaps, but the yells resound across the water. Your eyes sting; the wind is wild and in a moment blows the other way and you can barely hear the passengers. You see the vague shadow of the fairy running along the shore towards the ships.</p>
<p>And then no human sound halts both of you in your stride. The dragon emerges from the elms, shrieking and the beating of its great wings silencing all else. It soars over the river and then doubles back, plumes of flame bellowing from its wide mouth as it beats a spiral, the wind itself following in its path. The spiral emerges on the face of the river, growing and howling until it is a whirlpool and swallows the burning ships. The water separates from the water and the ships are wrecked. In a moment, they have disappeared. The surface is still. The dragon St!an flies into the darkness and the rustling trees.</p>
<p>In the moonlight, the fairy takes a few faltering steps before stumbling and falling. He makes no attempt to rouse himself. You walk up and lift him out of the miry clay.</p>
</section>
<section id="hopeless-aid" class="slide level1">
<h1>Hopeless Aid</h1>
<p>He fastens himself to you a moment. “Come on,” you say, “someone might have survived that.” You are a man from the south, steadfast and robust.</p>
<p>He nods and follows you north along the curve of the river. You cannot even see the boats until you draw close. And they are not boats even anymore, but a broad field of flotsam. There may be bodies among the wreckage. The fairy pulls off his shirt and flies out over the water.</p>
<p><em>If you can swim, do so. It will not help, there are no survivors.</em></p>
<p>Eventually, he pulls a few corpses to shore. They are mangled and burnt, but he recognizes one as his uncle. You bury it; there is nothing to do for the others. You return to the house. He spends hours looking out at the river, his expression unchanging. He shivers occassionaly, the night air against his bare chest. Eventually, though, he does rise.</p>
<p>“Those men were from the eastern militia,” he says, “Someone will have to tell the capital about this.” He does not, but clearly means to, invite you to join him.</p>
<p>You have your own purposes. He says that he understands but does not. Before you depart he embraces you and hands you a friendship pin. You hold it up as you leave; it has an address penciled on its back.</p>

<h1>The River</h1>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Hedgerow and stream and banks I see
Like gold thread shines each wooded height;</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The river goes west for miles. It is still early afternoon, but you do not know how long you will have to follow it downstream. You have never left your village. You do not know where the river leads, only that rivers lead somewhere.</p>

<p>Going west for miles, when California was burning I was not yet present, and the bright light flooded through all the red fire, and the red fire through all the bright light, and the bright light and red fire shone together, but the kettle had been left on the stove for too long and all the water boiled away. Going west for miles, the birds are all named after each other. An ox dead amid the cacti and a desert flower, <em>counting</em>. counting what?</p>
<p>Going west for miles, I mean adding. <em>Counting,</em> you go zero, one-two-three. <em>Adding,</em> you go zero, two-four-six. Going west for miles, I mean, and the world is full of fires and strangely deserts do not burn with the best of them. By going west for miles, I mean that the world is full of fires; I mean Dresden, the hazelnuts bouncing off Cuna’s tin roof at night. Can someone tell you the German word for mother? In Virginia a train following a river, going west for miles, derailed during a flood and still has not been dragged out; what I mean is that the world is full of fires.

<h1>Village</h1>
<p>At last you come to a village at the edge of the river. The suns have set and the village is unlit. It is defined by an eerie silence. Still, it promises something. So you pass down the streets hoping to meet someone. But no one is about, though you seem to glance figures moving in the shadows, eyeing you with distrust. Still, you move forward. After a moment wandering down the streets, a door fling opens. “Come in, quickly,” an elf-warlock says from the door.</p>
<p>As you enter, he slams the door behind you and pushes you up against it, a stave beneath your neck. “What master do you serve?” he asks with a hiss.</p>
<p>You stammer out your confusion. “You must serve someone,” he insists, “who is it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” you manage to say.</p>
<p>He relents, tapping you on the head with the stave. “An idiot, likely harmless,” he says to himself as he exits the room.</p>
<p>“Boy, why are you here?” he asks from another room.</p>
<p><em>Tell him your story.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="the-warlocks-house" class="slide level1">
<h1>The Warlock’s House</h1>
<p>He snorts. “I did not think anyone could be dumb enough to go after what they found in dreams. But if it means I can be rid of you, I will help you out.”</p>
<p>You tell him that you are just looking for a place to stay for the night and directions to the next town.</p>
<p>“Calm down. I’m helping you, am I not?” He beckons you into the kitchen, “The way I see it, there will be thousands of meatheads just like yourself, lining up for their shot to slay the maiden and save the dragon. Scratch that. Anyways, either one of youse guys somehow manages it or the neighborhood gets a lot more tolerable. What do you know about grammar?”</p>
<p>He puts a bowl of soup in front of you, potato and broth. Through a mouthful you ask, “Grammar?”</p>
<p>The warlock snarls at you, “Grammar! Optative, locative, bleeding dative, bleeding grammar!”</p>
<p>You cannot read and admit as much.</p>
<p>“How do you expect to kill the dragon if Ovid is out of your reach?”</p>
<p>“With a sword.”</p>
</section>
<section id="the-grammar-lesson" class="slide level1">
<h1>The Grammar Lesson</h1>
<p>The warlock slams his fist against the table; the bowl jolts and broth sloshes about the weathered pine. “This is typical. You think you can run away from home without knowing anydamn thing?”</p>
<p>And then he returns and is silent. You stare at the bowl. “I mean I guess I did, but, you know, my home was on fire.”</p>
<p>But he has his eyes closed and says nothing. In a moment, your hunger overcomes your embarassment and you finish the bowl. You consider leaving, but instead put your hand on his shoulder and say, “I’d like to learn grammar, if you really think it would help.”</p>
<p>He remains silent a moment. “Yes. At least the rudiments. I do not see how you will get anywhere otherwise.</p>
<p>“Okay. Tell me how you would decline ‘eternal sword.’”</p>
<p>You ask, “Decline? Why? is it too high up?”</p>
<p>He does not well contain his annoyance. “Use it in a sentence, at least.”</p>
<p>“Okay, umm, I want to get the eternal sword.”</p>
<p>“You messed it up. How did you do that‽ I just said the phrase not twenty seconds ago. It’s ‘eternal sword’ not ‘eternal sword.’ [<em>Sorry. — Translator</em>] Adjectives share the gender of the modified noun. How do you expect others to agree with you when you cannot agree with yourself?”</p>
</section>
<section id="end-of-lession" class="slide level1">
<h1>The End of the Lesson</h1>
<p>“I think I had better be off. Thank you for the soup.”</p>
<p>He halts you. “Stay the night; you will find nothing in the dark.”</p>
<p>You nod and turn to the window. The third sun will dawn soon and the sky is a deep, deep blue. “The night is a spoonful of diamonds.” You feel as if you were dreaming.</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Something my mother used to say,” you say.</p>
<p>He faces you with a strange tenderness, “I would not put much into your chances, but the way things are now, well. One can hope. Listen, I have nothing for you but advice. Leave early and speak to no one. There is a cave just south of the dam further downstream. There will be a fire, or you will make a fire, but he will not be in the fire.”</p>
