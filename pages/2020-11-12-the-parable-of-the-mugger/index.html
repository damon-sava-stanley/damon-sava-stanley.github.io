                        <br/>
                  <p>The innocent carried a basket of bread to their cottage at the outside of town. A light brown cloth lay over the bread, just as a light brown hood lay over the innocent’s hair. The mugger walked with a club-like walking stick, bashing it against rocks that rimmed the dirt trail. The morning sun was occluded by a lone cloud.</p>
                  <p>Meeting each other, the mugger raised his walking stick-like club and said to the innocent, “Give up the bread. I have a club.”</p>
                  <p>The innocent could see indeed that they had bread and the mugger had a club and, by his fearsome aspect, no compunctions in wielding it. “I will give you the bread, but tell me why you are taking it.”</p>
                  <p>“It is bread and I am hungry.” The innocent expressed surprise that the mugger would humor them.</p>
                  <p>They placed the basket on the ground so that it might be taken. A bird warbled, taking no notice of this exchange.</p>
                  <p>“Very well, but I am also hungry.”</p>
                  <p>This in turn seemed to come as something of a shock to the mugger, but they quickly had a reply. “If I rob you, I will get bread. If I do not, I may not.”</p>
                  <p>“If you rob me, I will not have bread. If you do not, you may yet.”</p>
                  <p>The mugger nodded, but proceeded. “There are others of my kind. If I do not take it, who is to say that it does not get taken. If I take from you, I am depriving a criminal and thereby doing some good.”</p>
                  <p>The innocent despaired. A cool breeze played at the dandelions that grew from about the stones, nothing in the world recognizing their despair. They tried one last response.</p>
                  <p>“There are not so many as all that.”</p>
                  <p>The mugger paused to appreciate this response before taking the basket. “Thank you,” they said, “this is all very interesting.”</p>
                  <p>“But you are still stealing the bread and the basket.”</p>
                  <p>The mugger shrugged. “I have the club; you have the bread.”</p>
