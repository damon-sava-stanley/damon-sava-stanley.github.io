                  — “The Strange Cloud,” Hirato Renkichi, tran. Sho Sugita</div>
                  <p>In Lars von Trier’s <em>Melancholia</em>, a rogue planet collides with the Earth. The impact is preceded by general denial — surely it could not happen — excepting the protagonist, Justine, who, by some unique faculty, just knows that it will. This impact, however, merits no distress: “The Earth is evil,” after all. The film’s scenario is a pessimistic one: the Earth will soon explode, and all of humanity’s long-term projects will fail. But the film uses that pessimistic scenario to express a deeper scenario: it is fine that everything, our projects, our lives, come to nothing. They were not worth anything to begin with. Our question for today is the following: is Justine right? is the Earth evil?</p>
                  <p>We need to pause a moment, before we’ve even started, to clarify our terms. Pessimism is an attitude towards a set of possible outcomes, in particular to be pessimistic is to believe that the expected outcome is bad. It is rational to be pessimistic towards the outcomes of a lottery: the likely outcome (your ticket losing) is not good and the good outcome is not likely. What Justine is expressing is not, however, pessimism towards some particular set of outcomes. It is instead a global pessimism: when it comes to how things are going to go <em>as a whole</em>, the prospects are not good.</p>
                  <p>There are a number of reasons you could believe this. The most straightforward is simply to look at what sorts of things happen around here and to notice that they’ve been largely pretty terrible and we don’t have much reason to expect that to change. Robert Burton in the <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em> articulates something like a defense of this form of pessimism.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                  <p>The heavens threaten us with their comets, stars, planets, with their great conjunctions, eclipses, oppositions, quartiles, and such unfriendly aspects. The air with his meteors, thunder and lightning, intemperate heat and cold, mighty winds, tempests, unseasonable weather; from which proceed dearth, famine, plague, and all sorts of epidemical diseases, consuming infinite myriads of men. At Cairo in Egypt, every third year, (as it is related by Boterus, and others) 300,000 die of the plague; and 200,000, in Constantinople, every fifth or seventh at the utmost. How doth the earth terrify and oppress us with terrible earthquakes, which are most frequent in China, Japan, and those eastern climes, swallowing up sometimes six cities at once? How doth the water rage with his inundations, irruptions, flinging down towns, cities, villages, bridges, &amp;c. besides shipwrecks; whole islands are sometimes suddenly overwhelmed with all their inhabitants in Zealand, Holland, and many parts of the continent drowned, as the lake Erne in Ireland? <em>Nihilque praeter arcium cadavera patenti cernimus freto</em>. [And we perceive nothing, except the dead bodies of cities in the open sea.] In the fens of Friesland 1230, by reason of tempests, the sea drowned <em>multa hominum millia, et jumenta sine numero</em> [many thousands of men, and livestock without number], all the country almost, men and cattle in it. How doth the fire rage, that merciless element, consuming in an instant whole cities? What town of any antiquity or note hath not been once, again and again, by the fury of this merciless element, defaced, ruinated, and left desolate?</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>However plausible this empirically-minded pessimism is, it cannot be Justine’s attitude. For here the great conjunction of Melancholia and Earth is not any sort of relief, but rather the final entry in a long, long list of calamities. The claim that the Earth <em>is</em> evil, rather than merely visited by evil, is a much stronger claim.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Burton would accept that, in a certain sense, the Earth is good, despite the overwhelming presence of natural evil. It is, after all, the product of a perfectly good God who created it and called it good. Before the Fall, there was no natural evil, and even afterwards all evil should be understood as necessary. On this view, one can accept moral explanations of natural phenomena. Why does the Earth exist as it does? Because it is good that it does so.</p>
                  <p>This is a claim that is almost without exception (Derek Parfit) defended only by theists. The standard view for atheists on this count then is, in the words of Bertrand Russell (<em>Why I Am Not a Christian</em>), "that good and evil are ideas which throw no light upon the nonhuman world. They might have some purchase in the human and animal worlds, as there might be perfectly good explanations of behavior that cite good and evil—St. Augustine stole a pear because it was evil for him to do so—but certainly we don’t need to, or further cannot sensibly, appeal to anything like this in explaining the behavior of rocks or galaxies.</p>
                  <p>A third possibility is that evil has genuine explanatory power in the nonhuman realm. Why are there cockroaches? Simply because it is evil for there to be so. This possibility, while it might be metal, is not particularly plausible. Therefore, when we understand Justine’s claim that the Earth is evil, we have to understand it not as the claim that that what explains the state of the world is evil. But it has to be something stronger than the claim that the Earth is a place where evil happens to happen quite a lot. Here is, I think, the most plausible and interesting version of this claim. Not only is the Earth such that it is inhospitable, hostile, evil for us. We, humans, sapient beings, are such that no Earth could be a home to us.</p>
                  <p>In the next section, I want to look at one way of elaborating this claim.</p>

                  <p>We’re going to pause for and take a digression to cosmic horror and hence, first, to H. P. Lovecraft. Call this the SEO-mandated section of the essay. To give you a brief intro to Lovecraft’s stories: the universe is filled with spooky aliens and gods, most of them can kill you, some of them almost certainly will kill you, but almost universally they’re not malicious, just indifferent to humanity. Often, merely learning about these spooky things is enough to spook the sanity right out of you.</p>
                  <p>I’ll return to one of those stories in a bit. For now, though, I want to talk about some of Lovecraft’s ideas. I need to credit S.T. Joshi’s <em>H.P. Lovecraft: The Decline of the West</em> as a valuable resource for this end. Here’s Lovecraft’s presentation of his so-called “cosmicism” in a letter.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                  <p>What does it all amount to, anyway? In a few million years there will be no human race at all. Man, at best, is but an incident—and a very trifling incident—in the limitless history of Nature…. Planets are born, die, and are born again—and so on without end. It really makes one quite dizzy to think of such expanded matters!</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Now, there are a couple of ways of understanding Lovecraft here. Either he’s merely reporting his own response to the scale of the universe, in which case fair enough, or else he’s intending to recommend this attitude: not merely that he finds the existence of <em>homo sapiens</em> a trifling accident, but that this is the correct way to think of that existence.</p>
                  <p>This latter interpretation is bold. It is not clear to what extent we should think that something can be <em>really</em> trifling or <em>really</em> important, as something over and above whether it happens to be found trifling or important. Usually, we allow that something is important or unimportant only relative to some end. If you intend to pass your introductory anthropology class, the existence of <em>homo sapiens</em> is of some moment. Down the hall, in the abstract algebra class, it is only of trivial interest that the results discussed were come to by a certain species of hominid. We typically allow some degree of freedom in setting one’s own ends.</p>
                  <p>Even if one thinks some ends especially choiceworthy (certain moral ends, for example), it is not clear why those ends would be such that matters central to human life turn out to be of no ultimate importance. It may be then that what Lovecraft intends is to be endorsing nihilism: not only is the cosmos indifferent to us in that good and evil do not figure into the explanation of non-human (or, properly, non-sentient or non-sapient) goings on, but good and evil themselves are empty concepts, illusions humans fashioned for one another. (Indeed, he would later claim “No one thing, cosmically speaking, can be either good or evil, beautiful or unbeautiful; for entity is simply entity.” It is unclear how one speaks cosmically or uncosmically, perhaps with sufficient reverb.) As a corollary to this, no end would be worthier of choice than any other and hence nothing would be important in some ultimate sense.</p>
                  <p>It, however, is a faulty inference to go from nothing being ultimately important to everything being ultimately trifling. Rather, all we can say is that things are important or trifling only according to one’s ends, just as we cannot say that anyone is ultimately a foreigner but someone is a foreigner or a compatriot only according to one’s nationality. If some things are <em>full stop</em> important, the cosmicist owes us much more than she has ever given about why humanity is not on the list. If nothing is important in that sense, then we might as well prefer the following converse attitude, which is anyways a sight cheerier.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                  <p>I admit I am so fashioned that I have only a resigned, and somewhat dismissive shrug for anything so super-impressive, so beyond all realization. Without doubt there is psychological pleasure in admiring greatness, in being enthusiastic about it, indeed in being overwhelmed by it, but that is only possible on a human and earthly scale that one can comprehend. The pyramids are great, Mont Blanc and the interior of St. Peter’s are great—that is, if one prefers not to reserve that attribute for the moral and intellectual world, for the grandeur of the human heart and mind. The dates of the cosmos’s creation are nothing but a numbing bombardment of our intelligence with numbers that come furnished with a comet tail of two dozen zeros and the pretense that they still have something to do with measurement and reason. For people like myself, there is nothing about this monster that could lay claim to goodness, beauty, greatness; and I will never understand the happy cries of “hosanna” that the so-called works of God—the physics of the universe, that is—can evoke from certain temperaments. And can a production ever be declared a work of God, if one’s response to it can just as well be “so what” as “hosanna”? It seems to me that the former is the better response to a dozen zeros after a one—or a seven, since that really makes no difference anyway—and I can see no reason for groveling in the dust to adore a quintillion.</p>
                  <p>— <em>Doctor Faustus</em>, Thomas Mann, tran. John E. Woods, 267f</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>I should mention that there’s another way in which one can take Lovecraft’s remarks here. He may have merely in mind the following sort of thought. There may be a list of the kinds of things that exist that are in some sense natural or privileged. It’s not clear in what sense, but we can say that there’s something funny about Borges’ “Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge” that is not funny about a periodic table of elements (at the least, the former is on the walls of very few high-school classrooms). Lovecraft is a materialist, and for the moment so are we, so nothing especially human, no souls, no vital essences, is going to appear on the grand list of fundamentally existing things. And similarly if you were to write the grand and supremely fair account of every event that ever happened in the world, a miniscule portion would deal with human affairs (particularly because, again, God does not exist and so we figure not at all in the explanation of why the world got to be the way it is). But that something takes up only a small proportion of an account that is in some sense neutral, does not mean that is comparatively unimportant. One thing can take up more space in such an account by being physically large, or persisting for longer, but these are not in themselves features that make something important.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
                  <p>Indeed, it should be noted that Lovecraft later came much to the same conclusion when he later wrote “Each person … [can] speak only for himself when he calls this thing ‘silly and irrelevant’ and that thing ‘vital and significant,’ as the case may be. We are all meaningless atoms adrift in the void.” It should be noted that the second sentence contradicts the first.</p>
                  <p>So much for cosmic insignificance. Let’s now briefly turn to Lovecraft’s presentation of <em>indifferentism</em> which connects more clearly to our discussion of pessimism.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                  <p>Contrary to what you may assume, I am <em>not a pessimist</em> but an <em>indifferentist</em>—that is, I don’t make the mistake of thinking that the resultant of the natural forces surrounding and governing organic life will have any connexion with the wishes or tastes of any part of that organic lifeprocess. Pessimists are just as illogical as optimists; insomuch as both envisage the aims of mankind as unified and as having a direct relationship (either of frustration or of fulfilment) to the inevitable flow of terrestrial motivation and events. That is—both schools retain in a vestigial way the primitive concept of a conscious teleology—of a cosmos which gives a damn one way or the other about the especial wants and ultimate welfare of mosquitoes, rats, lice, dogs, men, horses, pterodactyls, trees, fungi, dodos, or other forms of biological energy.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>As far as I can tell, though, Lovecraft is using “optimist” and “pessimist” in a peculiarly restricted sense. In particular, those we would usually consider pessimists don’t in general conceive of the aims of mankind as unified. So, for example, Schopenhauer, who Lovecraft on occasion cites, thought that existence is suffering (as suffering is the hindrance, for Schopenhauer, of will and forces and organisms strive and hinder one another and throw up always new ends so “there is no measure and end of suffering,” <em>World as Will and Representation</em> 56). Schopenhauer’s story here assumes on the contrary a disunity of mankind’s ends: it is precisely because of the disunity of our ends that the “inevitable flow of terrestrial motivation and events” will disappoint them.</p>

                  <li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>This discussion may have been partly opaque in detail to some readers. Those details are not crucial to the overall point that we should sharply distinguish the scale of some phenomena from its importance. Still, for the interested readers, in this aside I want to clarify these points.</p>
                  <p>Let’s start with a chicken on a farm. The chicken wakes up every morning. The sun is shining. The birds—the other birds—are singing. The farmer has laid out feed for the hen. She, to anthromorphize, thinks that things are always going to be as good as this. Sadly, she is mistaken. The farmer has a different plan: someday not too far off, the hen is to be slaughtered, plucked, cleaned, and hauled off to a supermarket.</p>
                  <p>The hen thought she could predict the future. She thought incorrectly. But we also, in similar ways, try to predict the future. More generally we seem to expect that what we have not observed will be similar to what we have observed. This is what scientists expect when they draw grand theories (which are supposed to apply also to unobserved cases) from a body of experiments and observations. Similarly it’s what we expect when we wait for the train to arrive at or at least sometime near the posted time. But it seems we don’t have any argument showing we have any right to expect this. As the chicken example makes clear, we cannot be absolutely certain that the future will be as we expect, so there’s not going to be any logical or conceptual demonstration showing the reasonableness of our expectation.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, if we consider how the world would have to be to make reasoning in this way (drawing conclusions about the unobserved from the observed) reliable, we can see that it would be the uniformity of nature: that is that all of nature is self-similar. Patterns that hold in one part of nature (e.g. the observed) tend to hold in the rest (e.g. the unobserved). Why would we believe that? It seems the only thing we could really say is that, well, the parts of nature we have observed are uniform, so nature as a whole is uniform. But it would be objectionably circular to mount this defense.</p>
                  <p>This is the problem of induction, brought home to us by Hume. The chicken example is Bertrand Russell’s. I’m not here interested in diving deeper into the problem or examining solutions or dissolutions. Rather I want to use this problem to springboard into another discussion. Suppose you find a solution or a dissolution. You convince us that it’s perfectly reasonable to believe that nature is uniform and so to engage in inductive reasoning is perfectly reasonable. Now you have another problem (courtesy of Nelson Goodman in <em>Fact, Forecast, and Fiction</em>).</p>
                  <p>Think about our chicken again. She reasons in the following way. Here’s something that’s true about today, I’m not dead. Actually, this is true about yesterday, and the day before that, and then going hundreds of days in the past. So probably, that will keep being true. I won’t die tomorrow. But here’s another somewhat more peculiar way she could have reasoned. Here’s another thing that’s true about today: either it is before tomorrow and I am not dead, or it is at or after tomorrow and I am dead. Actually, this is true about yesterday and then going hundreds of days in the past. So, probably, that will keep being true. Tomorrow, I will die.</p>
                  <p>So now we have two instances of the same pattern of reasoning, but with opposite conclusions. One of them has to be faulty. But why think that it’s the second, funny-looking one that’s suspect? That is what we want to say, but then we do have to say something about what it is to be funny-looking and why it’s so bad anyway for an inductive argument to be funny-looking.</p>
                  <p>Well, philosophers who want to defend science and common sense as not just parochial human practices but, actualy, good ideas, do have to give a theory of the funny-lookingness of inductive arguments. Here’s a popular style of answer given by David Lewis: some properties or features of the world are special: they’re <em>natural</em>. Somehow they “carve nature at its joints.” What are some natural properties? Well, the basic physical properties are probably on the list: mass, charge, spin, etc.. Weird disjunctive properties, like being alive if it’s before today or dead if it’s after today, those are not going on the list. An inductive argument is funny-looking just in case it generalizes over these weird, unnatural properties.</p>
                  <p>That’s that. So when I talk about the grand, supremely fair account of the world, I mean the description of the world that only talks about natural properties. It will tell you, say, where all the particles are at in time and space. It will tell you what they’re all up to. Here’s what it won’t tell you: where all the humans are at, what they’re thinking, what’s going up with them. Or at least, it will only tell you about them in the way that describing the particles I’m composed out of is a way of talking about me. And in this indirect way that we feature in this big book, we don’t figure much at all.</p>
                  <p>As I’ve tried to indicate, how much something figures in the big book is not a mark of importance. It’s a mark of size.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
