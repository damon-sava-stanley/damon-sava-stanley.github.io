| [right out of range of those sickening and](#sec:l21-23)
| [greasy sureties](#sec:l21-23)---[like \"back to our

| 
| [The homing instinct of a great deal](#sec:l24-25)

| [magnetism by which consequence springs](#sec:l25-27)

| 
| So, we could come off that standard, and
| "possessive individualism" would be *who we*
| *are*---the first city. Break the charter, lift
| the harlot's curse, the revolted abstraction
| of "populism" by which the dark is so feared.
| Holding hands is a disgusting trick, and is
| augmented by the expectation of plenty.
| 
| Which would set out our past as gained
| *into* the territory of fortune, and dispose of
| that lumpy yarn running back into the trees.
| Again, what we recall is the *choice*, of our
| prevalence, the rich garden of the climatic
| terrain. And choice is not then one *from*
| "the rest"---the élitist dream of the crown
| domed in the Castle of Gold---but an
| inclusion *within* that measure, of choice,
| the second city of this middle earth.
| 
| And the question of "exchange" is thereby
| also dismantled. The dispute, over how
| far the values are trimmed, is strictly a
| consequent disturbance, since "fair price"
| is only the extent of our fears in the
| chest, of whatever sundry moth & rust
| we see in our age. "*Our* age"---at it
| again, the credible is what we aptly wear
| in our timid & tender years. The standard
| is a *fear index*, a measure of what (for ex-
| ample) "*natural* gas" will do to a pre-
| carious economy. Whoever in some sheltered
| domain called that vapour "natural" deserves
| to laugh right into the desert. These are the
| arid displacements beyond which lies in its state
| the third city, or the jewel of the air
| 
| Further than this, up to our necks in our
| polluted history, the fourth city is not yet known.
| Going off the standard is thus far only a
| proposal: the mantle is warm and in
| constant flow, but no man has yet crossed
| the plains. No trumpets in any case for such
| *banal* folly: the modest hatred of our con-
| dition and the competition which we therefore
| call time. They will not sound, as we cannot
| yet see the other side, but we deserve to, and
| if we can see thus far, these are the few
| outer lights of the city, burning on the horizon.

Lots to say, I'll be a bit abbreviated. I'll start just working through
a reading of it on a phrase-by-phrase level, trying to puzzle through
what's going on. Maybe later I'll try to say something about the
aesthetics.

"Numbers in Time of Trouble"
============================

"Numbers in Time of Trouble." What "Numbers"? What "Time of Trouble"?

1.  *Numbers*. The most relevant sense seems to be "Many people or
    things" (OED "number" 12b.) or even "Those forming a specified
    class; the multitude, the public. *Obsolete*" (OED "number" 8b.)
    This is I suspect how the term appears in "city of numbers" further
    down. So "numbers in time of trouble" refers to *people* in time of
    trouble, but people insofar as they share those troubles with others
    (being one among a number of people). An alternative or additional
    reading would have numbers as, well, numbers in the mathematical
    sense, but likely focusing on their economic applications as prices.
    A third reading, which is less plausible but one I'm interested in
    exploring, is that the numbers are *the numbers* abstracted from any
    particular application. More on all this anon.
2.  *Time of Trouble*. The most natural reading is that the time of
    trouble is *now* (1968). In particular the time of trouble is the
    Irish Troubles, which had started a couple of years back. As we will
    see, this is very likely partly correct, but I think it's also a bit
    broader. The trouble is capitalism, colonial capitalism (Prynne is
    some sort of Marxist), of which the Troubles are a highly salient
    flareup.

Time is going to be a big thing going forward. In the title time is just
the when in which events happen.

"Whichever time standard we're on," (L1) {#sec:l1}
========================================

A time standard is a specification for measuring time. So for example,
by local standard time, "3:32 PM 2020-13-3" specifies the time it is
now, "4:32 PM 2020-13-3" the time it is in a minute. Time standards
include but are more general than time zones: for example there are time
standards used in astronomy that have nothing to do with the Earth's
rotation. Some relevant facts about time standards.

1.  The system of time zones is an invention of the 19th century,
    largely English, primarily meant to serve the needs of the colonial
    capitalist economy (to precisely coordinate, e.g., shipping by
    trains).
2.  Before industrialization and these global coordination of
    measurements, time standards were local, informal, loose.
3.  In 1968 Ireland's Standard Time Act put Ireland "on" a standard one
    hour in front of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT+1).

This last observation is part of the evidence for the titular trouble
being or including The Troubles. It is also a clear indication of
contemporary colonialism: even if the Irish succeed, as they would do,
in escaping direct colonial political control, one cannot so easily
escape from the economic mesh of colonial capital.

Okay, having started to deal with the time standard, let's talk about
the "we". Who are we? As per the title, I think we are the numbers, that
is the body politic. But I think the poem can be quite slippy with this
we: at times we are the colonized (the most obvious positions here,
given that the question of what time standard we're on is presumably
live here) but at others we are the colonizers.

This phrase is meant to capture that generality. "Whichever time
standard we're on" and, hence, whichever we who are on a time standard.

"the question / of how fast and whether it's worth it" (L1--2) {#sec:l1-2}
==============================================================

What question? Well, there are two: how fast? is it worth it? Deal with
them in turn.

1.  Presumably, how fast we're measuring time, i.e. how long is a *unit*
    of time. This is an interesting formulation as all time zones, being
    variations on Universal Time (\~GMT) have the same second.
    Astronomical time standards will differ on how long their units are.
    However, I'm not sure that we should think this literally, rather
    what matters is more the *political* or *economic* speed of a second
    rather than its literal duration. One of the effects of the
    capitalist mode of production is (1) the emphasis on speed and
    efficiency of work, (2) focus on punctuality as a result of the
    logistical needs of business rather than the physical/psychological
    needs of the human body (cf. African time). Colonized societies not
    only go on the time standard of their colonizers in a literal, legal
    sense, but also adopt their temporal culture.
2.  Given all that, there's an obvious question of whether one should be
    on any time standard at all. *Is it worth it?* The speaker will
    later suggest the answer is no (hence the preliminary proposal to
    come off the time standard), but of course people do go on the time
    standard in the first place because they take the answer to be yes.
    The pressure to participate in *exchange* outweighs these moral
    concerns. The time standard in this use, as a standard, assumes a
    normative dimension; it hooks up with a set of values, a way of
    life. But this permits a meta-normative question: how do we feel
    about that standard, those values, that way of life? The possibility
    of a transvaluation first broached here is something we will return
    to at several points.

Note that this phrase is included in the "Whichever," that is what is
about to be asserted applies however one answers the questions.

"we are / underlaid by drift in the form of *mantle*," (L2--3) {#sec:l2-3}
==============================================================

The phrasing here is very deliberate. What it means is just that we,
whoever we are, have beneath our feet the Earth's mantle, which is in
motion. But it's phrased so that what we are underlaid by, what we have
"laid or placed under or below" us is the motion itself, the drift,
which happens to be being performed by the mantle.

What is being contrasted here is two different axes of motion. There is
the revolutionary motion of the Earth about its axis, the motion which
gives us days/nights, which our time standards measure (time, Aristotle
tells us, is the measure of motion), which assumes such chief social,
cultural and economic import, this manifest motion. But then there's the
hidden motion of the mantle about the core. This motion, of course, is
hugely consequential: this is the motion that has shaped the Earth,
defined the geography on which all of this is happening. But it is not a
purposeful, regular motion in the way *rotation* is. Rather it is a
*drift* something continual, fluid, aimless.

Why the emphasis on *mantle*? It's the part of the Earth that is doing
the drifting, but it is a play on also the broader, figurative meaning
of "mantle" as any sort of covering. The Earth's mantle covers its core
(and the habitability of the Earth comes both from the heat and light of
the sun but also the residual dark heat of its core) and is in turn also
covered by the crust. I'll return to this when we talk about the word
"dismantle", but I think in part in casting our attention to what is
hidden, subterranean, and yet still a source of energy, a source of
motion, Prynne is gesturing towards a prelapsarian, Arcadian sphere. The
mantle, itself covered from the sun and divorced from the motions above
the crust, cannot be said to be on any time standard itself.

Hence we, whichever (different) time standards we're on and how that's
working out for us, have this primordial unification: we're all living
and working atop this world which is apart from all that.

"and / that should be at least a start." (L3--4) {#sec:l3-4}
================================================

This is what I was just pointing towards: this commonality should be
taken as a start, a starting point. What it's a start of or a start
towards we'll see later, but to prefigure it's not a return in any
straightforward sense. The mantle isn't a place anyone could live. What
is a start towards dismantling the time standard is coming to see some
domain as lying outside of it, and so to start to imagine some space for
ourselves outside of it.

Alright, time for sentence 2.

"If the woman / gets up in the morning" (L4--5) {#sec:l4-5}
===============================================

This isn't supposed to be an aesthetic evaluation, but I can't quite
help but mention how delicious the enjambment after "woman" is. In
general, enjambment creates a moment of tension or wonderment: "If the
woman"; if the woman *what*? If the woman gets up in the morning.

Which woman? We won't get much help from the text. Any woman, perhaps.
(But then why "the" woman?) Or the woman itself, the form of woman. (If
Platonic forms could have need of sleep.) The textual puzzle we're in is
the following: the woman, to be "the" woman, has to be distinguished
from others and yet there is no given distinguishing feature. Indeed, we
have no clear class from which she is to be distinguished.

I suggest reading "the woman" as we read the "we", the woman could be
anyone who is suitably distinguished to us: distinct enough, perhaps,
that we might notice when she gets up in the morning. Obvious question:
is this noticing meant to be romantic or sexual in some way? (Watching
someone get up often or paradigmatically requires some sort of
intimacy.) Likely yes, and then there is perhaps a hint towards a
heterosexual positioning of the "we" the reader/speaker (as default
male). This glimmer will be further brought out deeper into the
sentence, so hold that thought.

Finally (with respect to these first eight words) there's the "If" and
there's the getting up in the morning. Let's talk about the getting up
first. I spent the treatment of the first sentence going on and on about
time and the measurement of time. Getting up in the morning marks the
start of our habitual (one will want almost to say "ritual") activity.
(We were just talking about, in the end of the last sentence, a start to
a grand political/revolutionary project, here we have a much more
mundane, if more hallowed, sort of start.)

But while getting up in the morning, as an event, initiates our daily
relation to time, to acting in it, it is not naturally brought under a
time standard. After all, one does not always get up at the same time
each day, *the morning* and one's getting up in it drift when (relative
to mean time) they occur. Getting up in the morning, conceptually, on
its own, is something that belongs to a more informal, humane
relationship to time. This suggests a different prelapsarian past, not
the pre-human or un-human one I discussed with respect to the mantle but
a pre-industrial one.

But the sluggish looseness of "getting up in the morning" is itself
threatened and taken over by industrial capitalism. When one works, one
works almost always at specific times, where those times are specified
in relation to a time standard. Nine-to-five (if you're lucky). As a
result, one's getting up takes on a relation to the time standard
(usually with the mechanical aid of an alarm clock). So this
prelapsarian, romantic image is, sadly, already lapsed.

Which brings us, finally finally, to the "If". We, the reader, are here
to suppose that the woman gets up in the morning. Why "If"? Why suppose?
Is there, perhaps, a danger of her not getting up? Should we be worried
about this woman dying in her sleep?

I don't think so. In part this gets back to what we were discussing with
respect to "the woman" as a general, hypothetical figure. Suppose, dear
reader, there were a woman. Now (or, in the sequence of the text,
already) we are given a further supposition, take your hypothetical
woman and further suppose that she gets up in the morning. This
imaginary nature is at once strange (surely there are actual women
getting up in the morning, one needn't imagine them) and crucial: our
woman is to get up swaddled in morning, a bird, perhaps, rather than an
alarm chirping.

"you could say it / was to be anointed" (L5--6) {#sec:l5-6}
===============================================

"you could say it was" is a bit complicated, we'll skip it for a moment.
Let's talk about the big thing, the anointment. We have our
(hypothetical) woman, she's (hypothetically) getting up, to (you could
say) be anointed. What is it to be anointed? Consult our handy
dictionary: "Smeared or rubbed with any unctuous \[oily or greasy\]
matter; *esp.* having had oil poured on, as a sacred rite." (OED
"anointed, adj.", 1) So, going as we always do backwards, let's start
with the *esp.* Our hypothetical woman is doing this daily, habitual
thing, getting up, with the purpose of participating in a sacred ritual.
This would be a distinct linking of the habitual and the hallowed: the
human sphere outside of standard time is simultaneously something
divine.

Okay, we've seen that, I've wittered on about it. But just as getting up
can involve alarm clocks rather than birds, not all ointments are oils.
One can anoint oneself with soap, with moisturizer, with, particularly,
makeup. Are these activities disbarred from being "sacred rites"? A
certain Pop Art sensibility might liken the daily application of L'Oréal
to Extreme Unction, but this is not a position the text seems to have
any time for, as we'll see. But I do think the text invites us, through
the use of the term, to consider the possibility of the sacred becoming,
degenerating, being echoed in the profane.

One note is the purposiveness of "to be anointed". The woman is getting
up for some purpose, she has something to do. This is, already, a funny
way to put it. Getting up isn't fully a purposive activity. It's not
like, when asleep, you deliberate about whether to awake (although you
might decide not to go back to sleep having woken up). But what these
sorts of locutions mean is that this thing, whatever it is, is the or is
among the main goals of the day. This ritual, then is not merely sacred
but central, what one arises to do. (Which either thwarts or further
arouses one trying to understand these more mundane actions as ways of
being anointed.)

Returning, what's the function of "you could say it"? There's a subtle
ambiguity in the construction of the sentence. Here are two readings:
(a) "if the woman gets up in the morning, she might do something (dab
oil on her forehead, soap up, apply foundation, whatever) and you could
call that thing anointment" and (b) "if the woman gets up in the
morning, you could say that what she's doing is being anointed \[after
all, she's your imaginary woman, you can imagine her doing whatever\]".
When considering ambiguity we have to think not only of the meanings of
the various possibilities of resolving that ambiguity but also the
meaning of the text's having all of those as possibilities.

So in (a) what is emphasized in how we think of certain actions. Do we
allow ourselves to call this *X*---an application of this oil, this
soap, this makeup---"being anointed?" That is, do we permit ourselves
the application of this concept, and, concomitantly, do we thereby
permit ourselves to see the glimmer of the holy in this earthy *X*?
(Spoiler: no.)

In (b) instead the implicit question is whether we even allow ourselves
to even imagine this (again, probably hypothetical) woman to do
something that could count as being anointed? (Where we are holding
fixed the extension of "anointment".) Again, no, but the difference is
between what we can conceive of as real possibilities and how we
conceive of (how we describe) what are to us real possibilities.

In permitting itself to be ambiguous between the two readings, the text
invites us to consider ourselves as having both a readerly and writerly
agency: a freedom to interpret a situation and a freedom to act within
that situation. Applied to this circumstance, the ambiguity is between
conceiving of a certain archaic purity as being (or not being) a
possibility for some future, potential situation and between conceiving
of our actual situation as already containing (or not containing) that
purity. This ambiguity is entertained, as we will see, so that it can
later partially closed off.

"if that (in this time) / weren't so puny and obsequious" (L6--7) {#sec:l6-7}
=================================================================

Let me quickly talk about the grammar of the sentence. We have a
ingenious syntactic symmetry here, with two "if" clauses abutted.
Cognitively, this is a very demanding sentence. We have to imagine this
woman getting up, fathom who she might be, what her getting up might be,
what our supposing her getting up might entail, how we might think of
what she's doing (both/either *de re* and/or *de dicto*), and now on top
of all that, we've got to take that work we've done and stick a big,
fat, complicated negation in front of it.

What's "that"? What "that" is?

Simply, the "that" is our ("your") calling what the woman wakes up to do
"being anointed". If only, the sentence says, it weren't so "puny and
obsequious" to call what the woman was waking up to do being anointed.
To do this, the text suggests, is to think of anointment as a
possibility for ourselves. It is to say, no, we could get up and be
anointed. Or, more radically, something we do get up and do already
counts as being anointed. This is to buy into, it suggests, something we
have called quite prelapsarian, enchanted, one might say.

The time of trouble ("this time") is more hollowed than hallowed. To see
the daily and the sacred as (even potentially) in contact, is to adopt
quite a retrograde position (which is, I think, why the male,
heterosexual positioning is quite apt). It is puny: weak, enervated. It
is obsequious. Here, I think Prynne is trying to charge the word with
two of its meanings. First, "Dutiful in performing obsequies or showing
respect for the dead; appropriate to obsequies. Obsolete." (OED
"obsequious", 1b) Second, "Unduly or servilely compliant; overly
submissive; manifesting or characterized by servility; fawning,
sycophantic." (OED "obsequious", 2a) So to be romantic in this way is to
be overly dutiful, servile, in one's devotion to the dead. (The dead
what? The dead, disenchanted, archaically patriarchal world. As a
further tangent, what is important is not that the past at any
particular time did have these qualities---the family has always been an
economic unit---but we can, in imagining something as past, imagine it
as being possible, even if not possible for us now.)

"The wrong / standard makes it so" (L7--8) {#sec:l7-8}
==========================================

Here's where we start linking the first two sentences. The "wrong
\[time\] standard" makes it the case that one cannot honestly conceive
of someone (the beloved, perhaps) waking up to be anointed.

I've discussed a bit already why that might be the case. Part of what is
involved in or rather around the time standard is the regimenting of the
workday: one is to clock in and clock out at certain times, to show up
to appointments at given times, etc. One gets up, in this time, under
this time standard, to go to work. One anoints oneself, if you can call
it that, perhaps with makeup, but one does that in turn for work (or for
the bit of life which is outside work).

Here, "the time standard" is a metonym also for the time (the
industrialized present) and the standards of those time: the broader
norms, broader ingrained expectations.

It's interesting here that it's the "wrong" standard that does it. This
suggests or at least leaves tantalizingly open that there might be a
right standard, one that does not have this brutalizing effect. What
would this be?

One thing I've previously mentioned is that we can think of this more
natural, more sacred, more whatever, way of living one thinks of in
thinking of this woman getting up, as being on a time standard. It's an
informal time standard, one where you measure times by mornings and
afternoons and getting ups and going to bed rather than by hours, but it
is still a way of measuring, of parceling up time. So, the text might be
saying, if there is a right time standard, it's that one, the one we
lost (if we ever had it). This raises a puzzle when we get to the
proposal to go off the standard that we'll have to deal with in a
minute.

The point about metonymy is just to say that it's obviously not a
specification for measuring time that caused this, whatever this is.
This is important as "wrong" applied to time standards is something like
a category mistake: time standards just tell you how to count time. As
mere conventions they can't be wrong in themselves, but they can perhaps
be *wrong for us* (i.e. bad for us to use), which is the sense intended.
(This is "wrong" in the same sense as we can say "I put on the wrong
sweater"; it's not that the sweater is itself wrong but that it's wrong
for us to wear it, perhaps given our sense of style.)

"and the brutal fact / is that there's no simple difference of opinion / involved:" (L8--10) {#sec:l8-10}
============================================================================================

That this time standard (and the system that foisted it on us) is wrong
for us is no matter of opinion. I spent a bunch of words a couple of
posts back about a way of understanding the previous sentence as
considering and rejecting the possibility of reaching paradise by mere
interpretation: take the woman and interpret whatever she's doing as
sacred. Except you can't; the age has sapped all such possibilities. The
time standard is wrong and its being wrong is something *objective*: not
a matter of mere opinion.

That's fairly straightforward. I'm a bit stuck on brutal. My first
instinct is that it means "Very bad or unpleasant" but the OED says this
is chiefly North American, so I'm not quite sure this is meant. But
similarly we might have "Inhuman; coarsely cruel, savage, fierce." That
inhumanity might be the key here: after all the wrongness of the time
standard has nothing much to do with us, with our opinion. So what is
brutal is, in part, the limit of our interpretive powers: we can't wish
our way back to Kansas.

"the wrong is an *entailment*," (L10) {#sec:l10}
=====================================

Here I think by entailment we mean "*Philosophy*. \[compare entail v.2
5\] The strict or logically necessary implication of one proposition by
another." (OED "entailment n.2", 2) That the time standard is wrong is
entailed by, follows necessarily from, some other fact? But which fact?

This is one of the most discussed question in ethics: what are the moral
facts (including the fact that this is the wrong standard) entailed by?
The speaker here is playing a coy here.

I would note that entailment is also a legal term. To entail is "To
convert (an estate) into a 'fee tail' (feudum talliatum); to settle
(land, an estate, etc.) on a number of persons in succession, so that it
cannot be bequeathed at pleasure by any one possessor." (OED) Under this
reading the wrong of the time standard (and the time standard itself) is
something already passed down, something we are not at pleasure to
bequeath. This fits nicely with the discussion of history to follow.

I've already suggested, with *mantle*, that we should understand the
emphasis as sometimes indicating that the word in question is
supercharged with meaning, so we should take both of these as permitted
readings and then we have to make sense of what the ambiguity means.
Both of these readings give the wrongness of the standard a certain
solidity, whether it is some sort of robust, philosophical
mind-independence or the superstructural solidity of the law. I think
the poem is concerned with the question of how solid any of these
institutions are. Might they just "melt into air"? Could we make them?
(Could we come off the time standard?)

I want to broach in this connection the Kantian conception of time.
Kant, insofar as I understand him (hint: not much), holds that time is
not a mind-independent feature of the world but something added by the
mind. Temporal relations are not subjective in the sense of being under
our control, there is an intersubjective robustness there, but we might
imagine different beings (particularly God) who do not have the same
form of inner intuition, the same time, as we do. (It's worth noting
that for Kant our a priori intuition of time is at the foundation of
mathematics and our construction of numbers.) I don't think there's an
explicit reference here, but Kant at least provides an interesting model
for this intermediary solidity: where something is not a mere matter of
opinion but neither is it something noumenal, outside the realm of our
experience.

"and / follows into the glowing tail of"history\"\" (L10--11) {#sec:l10-11}
=============================================================

Let's start with the glowing tail. There's obviously the comet metaphor
to come, history as something that blazes across the sky, the time
standard nipping at its heel. We'll get back to that image, I first need
to say something about "history".

History is both the sequence of events in time (in the sense that
something can be an historical event) but also the study of and
narratives about those events (in the sense that I could enter the
history department or read a history of industrialization). I think
we're meant to think of both, but the scare quotes ask us to focus on
this latter understanding, in which "history" can come apart from, being
both different from and misrepresenting, history. In this sense
"history" rather than history is the comet: "history" is what we can see
(history, having already passed, being now inaccessible), it is glowing,
and "history" rather than history has an arc, is moving in some definite
direction and so has a tail.

The idea that history has a direction has a long, well, history. Some
enlightenment figures (Kant, Hegel) thought of some sort of republican
maybe cosmopolitan state as the direction in which history heads.
(Kant---and probably Hegel but I know nothing about him---is more
complex here and closer to how I read this poem. He thinks of history
having a direction as a regulative principle of "history" as a form of
inquiry: that is in order to think of the events of history intelligibly
we sort of can't help but think of them as having an order, but this,
perhaps, says more about us than it does about the events.) Some
Marxists, probably not Marx, thought of Communism as the end point of
history (put a pin in this). Recently you have the Fukayama "End of
History" / Thatcher "No Alternative" conception of neoliberal capitalism
as the endstate of history. This view is often a bogeyman and this poem
seems to agree, it's "history," not history, that has a tail.

(Funny thing about comets, usually they're in orbit and reappear,
e.g. Halley's comet is on a cycle of something like 72 years. Another
historically popular, more recently unpopular view is that history
itself is circular. Put the same pin here, we'll talk about this in a
second.)

Note that we have not only the lovely sonic repetition of "tail" from
"entailment", but perhaps also quite a meaningful one, as the legal
sense of "entailment" comes from a legal sense of "tail".

> The limitation or destination of a freehold estate or fee to a person
> and the heirs of his body, or some particular class of such heirs, on
> the failure of whom it is to revert to the donor or his heir or
> assign. (OED "tail, n.2", 3a)

So to entail some estate is to leave it to a series of inheritors who
are not free to further bequeath that estate. The tail seems to be
related but a bit different: it's the limited giving of an estate to
some folks where it might revert to its giver's hold should we fail. If
"history" has a glowing tail, then, it means we are the inheritors of
"history" (a common thought) but that further we might lose that
inheritance should we not behave. (Though this might not be all that
bad.) I can't quite make sense of "glowing" on this reading, but it
might be available as a secondary meaning.

Finally (for these eight words) I want to say something about the
relationship of the time standard to history, or rather to "history".
Time standards are of course of deep relevance and interest to
historians. Historians want to place events in a single order in time,
but the accounts they have to work with are generally given with some
particular time standard. So they also have to work with those
standards, figure out how to convert between them; this can be
nontrivial. Further, the institution, adoption, use of time standards
are themselves events in history. I think it is in part this sense in
which the wrongness of the standard "follows into the glowing tail of
'history'", as both part of the subject matter of "history" (history,
particularly when we are thinking of the time standard as metonymic for
a larger system) and part of the construction of "history".

"as / for example the Marxist comet burns with / such lovely, flaring destruction." (L11--13) {#sec:l11-13}
=============================================================================================

Marxism is both a part of "history" and history. Often it is a counter-
or revisionary "history," as Marxists offer their own telling or at
least their own explanations of the events of history. It is in this
sense where there could be a (mainstream) "history" comet and a separate
Marxist comet.

Marxism is of course part of history (salient events: student riots in
France in May 1968, obviously the background of the USSR and other
communist or socialist countries around the globe). As such it is
"flaring," i.e. "shining brightly and fitfully" (OED "flaring, adj" 4),
coming up in the occasional revolution or riot, and lovely.

It is a tricky matter to decide how lovely the comet here is supposed to
be. There is a certain textual distance, the Marxist comet is just an
example of an "history" and in this context then is something that is
followed by the wrongness of the time standard. We might think that
Marxism defines itself in opposition to the time standard and its
wrongness, broadly construed. The poem is allied with it insofar as it
also seeks the destruction of the standard (hence its loveliness), but I
suspect it is seeking to transcend "history", to get off the standard,
in a way that it, perhaps, it does not view the Marxist comet as capable
of.

It's worth bringing back in the observation that comets are cyclical
events to note that this applies to Marxism and the occasional, fitful
nature of its interventions into history.

Lastly, we should note in astrology, historically speaking, comets are
signs of disaster; there being then a nice confluence with some Marxist
rhetoric (communism as the specter haunting Europe).

"That we could come off the time standard is / a first (and preliminary) proposal;" (L14--15) {#sec:l14-15}
=============================================================================================

I've hopefully said enough to make sense of why the speaker would here
be proposing that one comes off the time standard. But what I do need to
talk about what that proposal involves.

In this context, we should understand "coming off the time standard" as
ending the economic system that the time standard was created to
facilitate: industrial (global) capitalism. So we're talking about
envisioning the end of capitalism. In general there are a couple of
models for the end of capitalism: going *outside* of capitalism and
going *through* capitalism. In the first model, one imagines some event
(the Russian Revolution, at this time with any hope May 1968), some
definite intervention into history that (1) disrupts/breaks the economic
system and (2) replaces it with something else. In the second, one
imagines instead the end of capitalism as not some intentional,
collective achievement, but instead something that happens "from the
inside". This is the "(left) Accelerationist" vision, though already
prefigured in the Marxist idea of the "internal contradictions" of
capitalism. One imagines that the capitalist economy becomes even more
productive but hence less regulated, more prone to breakage until it
does and then (somehow) something else, better, replaces it.

Now, what's imagined here is very likely in line with (1). After all,
this being a proposal, something we could do intentionally, speaks of
this as being conceived of as an intervention into history rather than
an unfolding of history. But, because I can, I want to ramble a bit
about (2) as it feels too of the moment to let pass (and no one can stop
me).

When we think of an intervention or any deliberative action we tend to
think of it as this two stage process: first you deliberate, then you
act. Here deliberation is essentially computational: you think of what
the various possible actions are, what possibilities might follow from
those actions, how probable those possible outcomes are, how desirable
those outcomes are, and then you weigh them all up and come to some
decision about what to do. Then you go ahead and do the darn thing.
There's all sorts of ways to do this better or worse (you can miss a
possible action, misevaluate the likelihood or desirability of an
outcome, misweigh things, be *akratic* and fail to do what you decide to
do), but the reason we care about this model is that it describes a sort
of ideal of decision making. When a person does this correctly and
fully, they've made the best decision they could make.

Importantly, though, in our vision of this process, deliberation happens
outside of time, or at least takes no time at all. This ideal
deliberation then is a form of rational activity, but its the
rationality of angels, i.e. of beings who can think infinitely fast. But
human deliberation takes time, it is itself an event preceding action,
and the amount of time it takes can be extremely salient. If you don't
decide which way to turn in time, you will crash. Less dramatically, if
you take hours each morning deciding what to wear, you'll never get
anything done. So what we have to do is this actual, nonideal, bounded
deliberation, it is still a rational activity, but it is a form of
machine rationality. Plausibly, nonideal deliberation would converge on
ideal deliberation, if you gave the machine (or person) infinite time to
deliberate.

Sometimes, when we have oodles of time to deliberate, we can gloss over
this distinction, we can pretend to be mediocre angels. But, and this is
something that Accelerationists stress (e.g. Nick Land talks a lot about
this), when everything is going fast and *will go faster* we don't have
time to think. We can less and less pretend to be angels (and at certain
speeds even the machines break down). (This is part of the
Accelerationist critique of the old model: the acceleration itself makes
*deliberate* intervention less and less possible.)

Why this feels important to think about now is that the coronavirus and
its global effects play interestingly with both models. The logistic
spread of an infectious disease is its own unpolitical, supereconomical
accelaration. This ensures that we are firmly in machine time, worried
not only about what responses to the virus will be effective, but how
fast we can make the decisions themselves (every delay is costly and
itself changes the deliberative space: South Korea's response of mass
testing is perhaps possible early on, when there are few cases, but is
insufficient as the pace picks up). But, at the same time, capitalist
acceleration is coming to a screeching halt, as lockdowns and social
isolation bring economic activity to a crawl. For many of us, then, with
our economic lives halted or slowed down, we now have nothing but time
for reflection, for deliberation (the plague has made angels of us all).

Note I said "logistic" rather than "exponential". This is another
tangent, but let's roll. The "Accelerationist" rhetoric is focused on
exponential, or at least super-linear growth. But this isn't how any
growth actually works. For all actual growth is always bound by some
underlying resource (for the virus, uninfected persons; for animals,
food, water, etc.) and growth slows and caps out as the resources get
used up and access to the resource becomes more difficult. Since
resources can be exhausted, this growth reverses itself as resources
begin to be used up (e.g. people develop immunity or die). These produce
the "boom" and "bust" of the epidemeological curve (the one we're
supposed to flatten). Of course, not all resources are permanently
exhausted and you can get subsequent booms and busts as the population
dies out, resource-use thereby lets up and so resources stockpile again
(in the virus case, you get a whole new set of resources when the virus
mutates past immunity; this also accounts for the cyclical boom and bust
of predator-prey populations). So although our rhetoric has capitalist
growth as always accelerating, it is of course still resource bound with
resources that regenerate to different degrees, so, unless something
radical changes (basically, an apocalyptic scenario happens, or we enter
some utopian paradise where, e.g., we manage to achieve zero-growth)
human population and all economic activity will follow this basic
pattern. So even if you buy the Accelerationist idea that some part of
the curve will destroy capitalism you might well disagree where on the
curve we could reach. Here are some broad options.

1.  The approach to the boom, as things accelerate.
2.  The release of the boom, as things decelerate.
3.  The start of the bust, as things go into decline.
4.  The end of the bust.

Then of course there's the capitalist realist option that the system
somehow survives all of this. This sort of inquiry towards what might
happen is essentially passive, it asks "What will happen?" But one can
also think about the future not in a merely investigative, passive way,
but actively, asking "What is to be done?" (Though, if one thinks of
oneself as an angel, these are two ways of asking the same question.)

Now, I described this time of slowdown as a time of deliberating, but
part of what motivates Accelerationists (particularly non-left ones) is
the thought that the intellectual class who at least partially are
investigating the future, who (very partially) understand some of these
dynamics, and particularly the bourgeois, leftist intellectuals who
would want something else to happen are ultimately powerless with
respect to how things will go. To the extent they are asking "What is to
be done?" they are deluding themselves. We are condemned to the actual.
Indeed Accelerationism (particularly in Land's writing) has a
post-humanist streak: part of the way in which the economy is
transformed is that it is fully mechanized, as the deliberative computer
comes to outperform the deliberative human, one no longer uses machines
to answer "What will happen?", "What is to be done?" but the machines
answer these themselves. In this sense, the useless, anxious *seeing*
and *foreseeing* which is the lot (perhaps) of the academic left, the
present lock-downed, will become not the permanent but the final state
of humanity as a whole.

So much depends on factors that are extremely difficult to assess. How
long does it take for machines to think? (We have a long history of
being overly optimistic here. Turing in his original paper thought we'd
have human-level intelligence in computers by the 21st century.) How
long do we really have of continued development? Given the state of our
resources (and a livable climate is a resource), do we really have time
to develop it? We might be not on mean time anymore but coyote time,
having taken our first few panicked steps into thin air.

All of this is extremely speculative, nothing but speculation. But it
gets at the question of agency raised in this passage (oh, yeah, we were
talking about a poem, weren't we?).

Okay, so by my count we still haven't figured out exactly what this
proposal is. But we have made progress by raising another question
(reraising an old question), who is this "we" that the proposal is
addressed at. (Actually, this assumes that the proposal is addressed to
the same "we" who will be coming off the standard.) We've already noted
that the "we" in this poem is unstable and uncertain. There are a few
possibilities.

1.  A restricted "we": we are those who recognize the desirability of
    going off the standard.
2.  A broader but not universal "we": we Britons, we Irish, we whatever.
3.  A universal "we": workers of the world, people of Earth.

I think this matters because there are two different features pushing us
in two different directions. The first is the global nature of the
condition: the time standard governs us all. The second though are the
limits on collective agency. That is, when one thinks of some group
taking some deliberative action, we think of it as along the lines of
individual deliberative action. There is a group consideration of
possible actions, outcomes, evaluations, etc., in coming to a single
decision. For a group of people then to be a deliberative body it must
be possible for them to come to agreements about these things. They need
to share or to be able to come to share views about what the options
are, what the outcomes might be, how likely they are, and, crucially,
how good they would be. The bigger, the more spread out, the more
diverse a collection of people is the less sense it makes to talk about
them as deliberating.

I think when a speaker uses "we" in this deliberative, political way
where the speaker is trying to get the audience to do something, who
belongs to the fact is fixed after the fact. The "we" is the largest
group who are likely to decide together to do the thing being
recommended (even if that recommendation is aimed more generally). This
is of course taking "proposal" in its most direct, common sense, that of
"An act or (less commonly) the action of proposing that something be
done, or of proposing to do something; a suggested or intended plan,
scheme, or course of action; spec. one submitted formally for
consideration." (OED "proposal. n", 2a)

But there is another sense of "proposal" that is also germane here. That
of "The action of presenting something to the mind for contemplation; an
instance of this; a prospect. *Obsolete*." (OED "proposal. n", 1b) That
is, we can understand the proposal of coming off the time standard as
*here's a thing we should do* (which would require for its success our
being in a position to deliberate together) but *here's a possibility*
(which does not have that requirement).

Is this a viable reading? (Not as a replacement to the obvious, but as a
secondary meaning.) Well, why might we be getting a proposal in this,
weaker sense? We'll start with a bit of a detour. Here's a question
leftists have to face: if capitalism is so bad, why does it still exist?

There are of course different and complex answers to this question, but
a very common theme here involves *ideology*: that is, alongside
capitalism are disseminated and imposed a set of beliefs, sentiments,
attitudes among the populace with the overall result that they, in
general and for the most part, view the economic system *which is (in
general and for the most part) harming them* as natural, both in the
sense of good, wholesome and organic, inevitable ("there is no
alternative"). We'll come back to this as ideology is a major theme both
later on in this poem and throughout Prynne's work.

If you take the hegemony of the ruling class to be thus in large part
ideological, you will think of *consciousness raising* (the expose of
the dominant ideology as, crucially, false, the denaturalization of the
current order) as a necessary part of any revolutionary project. One can
then view this as the aim of this proposal (where to propose in this
sense is literally to raise to consciousness). So the point of the
proposal---go off the standard---is to raise to consciousness the (1)
possibility and (2) potential desirability of completely changing
economic system. This counter-ideological work can be done even if the
proposal is not taken up (in the primary sense of "proposal").

This duality lives also in the adjectives applied to the proposal,
"first (and preliminary)". In the primary sense, we can take this
proposal as first (and preliminary) in that it's partial, it sketches
the first steps of a program but doesn't tell you what to do next. (What
follows coming off the time standard?) But in this second sense it is
not the object of proposal, what is proposed, but the action of
proposing that is first, preliminary (this trades on another ambiguity
in "proposal" between proposal in the sense of that which is proposed
and proposal in the sense of an act of proposing, e.g. a marriage
proposal). That is consciousness raising is the first step in a
revolutionary project, we must come to see as possible, to see as
desirable a better future before we can start to work towards that
future.

This might begin to help us understand the sense in which this is an
atypical leftist proposal. We might distinguish the form of an economy
(who benefits and how, who has ownership or control) from its matter
(what is being produced where). Most leftists proposals center around
the former: what we want is worker ownership, worker benefits. Now, the
latter is not ignored: concerns about sustainability, the health and
safety of workers, desires for shorter hours, these are all things
leftists care about that have to do with the matter of the economy. But
usually we're a bit less radical here, insofar as the goal is not to end
industrial production.

Going off the time standard, though, does seem to be revolutionary
largely in terms of matter rather than form. If the time standard is
necessary for global, industrial production, then what can coming off
the time standard mean but an end to global, industrial production?
Might we even think of it as a turning-back-the-clock (to feudalism,
perhaps, or even before)? Understood in this way it sounds almost
primitivist.

Think about what I said about the woman getting up in the morning (I
know, ages ago). There we were talking about disenchantment and the role
the time standard (industrialization) perhaps had to play in that
disenchantment. Is this then a reactionary, even primitivist proposal?
We'll have to really bear this in mind, but I don't think this really
fits with the rhetoric. Rather, I will suggest, that this is an even
more preliminary proposal than all that, looking not towards a return to
history (reaction) or even a future communist state, but looks beyond
history: the abolishment of the time standard as an abolishment of
*time*. This is a weird proposal for a reading, but it's a weird
proposal.

One benefit of this odd, transcendent reading is that it goes some
distance towards the question of *difficulty* of this poem. Why is this
poem as inaccessible as it is? (Nowhere near Prynne's late works but
still up there among modernist poetry.) Particularly when it seems to
have didactic content. That is, if this proposal is more than merely
aesthetic, i.e. if it is in part intended as a sincere proposal (either
as a real proposal or a bit of consciousness raising), then it would
seem to make sense to make this proposal as clearly as possible. (Of
course, it's always possible that one might drape a fairly commonplace
political message in dense, highly aesthetic garb, more concerned with
the aesthetics of politics than politics through aesthetics. This
practice has a long history. Still, though, it's a bit peculiar.) If,
however, what is proposed is not straightforwardly political, in the
sense of being directly actionable, then this tension disappears.
Indeed, there may be some reason to encode it in this way, to reach
outside the current or, at least, the ordinary.

"having / nothing to do with some zeal" (L15--16) {#sec:l15-16}
=================================================

This proposal (come off the time standard) or maybe rather the act of
proposal have nothing to do with *some zeal*. We'll get in a little bit
what the zeal would be towards in a second, but first let's talk about
it in the abstract. By zeal we mean a passion, usually an excessive
passion, religiously or (especially relevant) a politically directed
passion. You can have a zeal for your faith or some program. Here we're
declaiming such passion, or, at least, claiming that there is no
connection between the passion and the proposal.

Of course, this is some sort of revolutionary, political proposal so
this insistence is interesting. In politics, zealotry is usually applied
to radical proposals: the person who wants to unmake or remake society
is *zealous*, in the grips of a mad passion and unable to listen to
"reason". Of course, from a leftist perspective, i.e. in reality, this
positioning is itself merely ideological: it is the "reasonable", the
"unzealous" centrists, who are most in the grip of a blinding passion.
The reasonableness is merely an aesthetic: since the centrist can point
to two "extremes", since she is already politically ascendant, she can
claim her proposals to be reasonable, realistic compromises, which
amounts only to their similarity to which proposals in the past as
opposed to the novelty (in a narrowly defined context) of the radical
proposal.

To position, then, this proposal as unzealous is then to further engage
in consciousness raising: it is to begin to undo the ideological
construction of the actual as natural, as reasonable by positioning a
desirable, distant possibility as instead, or at least additionally,
dispassionate and thereby realistic. It also fits in with our
understanding of the poem as laying outside the ordinary remits of
political proposals (much more on which anon).

"about traverse" (L16) {#sec:l16}
======================

I admit, I've kind of been stuck on "traverse". It's sort of a weird
noun, you usually expect it as a verb or related words as a noun
("traversal"). But, okay, "traverse" is what we have and we have to make
do. For one it has many meanings (the OED has 40 senses for it). Most of
the immediately obvious, current senses, have to do with traverse as
some sort of movement or passage.

-   15a. An act of travelling or journeying right through, over, or
    across a country, region, type of terrain, etc.; a period of
    travelling through a place or along a route; a journey.

-   16a. An act of sailing short distances in different directions
    successively, typically when tacking in order to reach a point to
    windward; each of the short runs made by a boat or ship sailing in
    this way. Also: the irregular or zigzag course taken by a vessel
    sailing in this manner.

-   17a. A course by means of which an area or physical feature can be
    travelled or crossed; a route, a path; a pass.

-   \\18. figurative and in figurative contexts. Anything presented as
    or likened to a journey or act of travelling; esp. a survey, review,
    or consideration of a subject, argument, body of work, etc.

-   19a. The action or fact of moving, esp. in a particular direction or
    course; movement; passage.

Some other senses that seem particularly relevant have to do with
conflict and struggle.

-   \\1. Something that thwarts, obstructs, or hinders; an obstacle; an
    impediment. Cf. sense 6. Obsolete. \[As a side note, one of OED's
    examples here is a biography of Oliver Cromwell.\]

-   3a. A difference of opinion; a dispute; a controversy. Obsolete.

-   \\4. A contest. Obsolete. and exa

-   16b. *figurative.* A change or alteration; a vicissitude; esp. a
    twist of fate or fortune. Frequently in plural with of. Obsolete.

What are we to do with these? Well, we might think that travel
(particularly nautical) and conflict are the two primary activities of
colonialism. You first cross the ocean, then you brutalize whomever you
find there. But wait. Wasn't I just going on and on about how the time
standard was all about colonialism and capitalism and all that shebang?

If that is right, how can coming off the time standard *not* have
anything to do with all that?

Well, of course, the time standard is in the first case a requirement of
industrial production and only thereby connected to colonial capital, as
an industrialized economic system. In particular, an industrial
socialist/communist society would still be post-time standard, even if
they were non-imperial, i.e. post-traverse. This then suggests that the
poem is looking further, towards what Marx (in *Critique of the Gotha
Program* calls a higher form of communism), which is no longer tied to
industrial labor. So coming off the time standard could be a proposal
that looks further than the end of capitalism.

"or the synchronous double twist of a minor / protein." (L17--18) {#sec:l17-18}
=================================================================

This is even more difficult. The "double twist" makes one think DNA, and
that is certainly what is intended, though with some poetic license as
DNA is not a protein, minor or otherwise.

We'll deal more with how DNA is described. But what is it doing here?
This is part of the general move of the poem which is to go beyond
politics to something more fundamental (the mantle, which is outside of
human perception). DNA is an essential part of all sufficiently complex
life. But this proposal is claimed not to have anything to do with that.

It is hard not to see the proposal as neo-Platonic. Presuming the
proposal is a proposal for us (humans), but it has nothing to do with
our physical existence, then one might take it as directed towards us as
nonphysical. For Plato, there is the physical world of becoming, which
is essentially temporal and ever-changing, and then there is the
nonphysical world of being, the eternal Forms. As embodied creatures, we
are involved in this physical world, but as thinking creatures we are in
a way part of the other world. Plato further thought that through the
right study (philosophy) we could gain access to the forms. We might
take the proposal, then, as one involving a kind of spiritual separation
from the physical world. (Which is not apolitical; indeed the
neo-Platonist Plotinus once sought to found a new city, Platonopolis,
which might be a kind of fifth city.)

If we read it in this way, "minor" makes sense. In calling DNA a "minor"
protein (in the sense of being of minor importance), we might initially
take it in a cosmological sense: DNA is one compound that occurs on one
planet out of an untold number of planets. But there is another sense in
which it can be taken: DNA is a minor protein even from a human
perspective, because our embodied life is only a small and lesser part
of our entire existence. (We might also think of "minor" in the sense of
minority, suggesting that life itself is still in a relative sort of
infancy.)

The word "synchronous" of course is time related, though it is not being
used in its primary sense of "Relating to or treating of different
events or things belonging to the same time or period; involving or
indicating contemporaneous or simultaneous occurrence." (OED
"synchronous, adj" 1b) Instead, I take it to concern the shape of DNA.
"Recurring at the same successive instants of time; keeping time *with*;
going on at the same rate as two sets of vibrations or the like." (OED
"synchronous, adj" 2a) DNA's two strands move in opposing but
synchronous vibration. Again, our embodiment is fundamentally defined by
time: it is synchronous with itself but also with an external time
standard.

"We could come of all that, to-/gether, into the nearest city of numbers" {#sec:l18-19}
=========================================================================

Most of this has been talked about, so I will add some scattered
thought. The proposal is reiterated. We have talked a bit about
"numbers," but this is an opportunity to re-suggest the literal reading.
For Plato, the numbers are forms (indeed, neo-Platonists, branching off
Platonic esoteric doctrines, take this even further: everything is
derived from "the One" and "the Two"). So a city of numbers could be
taken as a place only in a metaphorical sense: as a collection of forms.

In this connection it is worth raising two other meanings of "city,"
other than the primary sense of city as municipality.

-   4a. With modifying word or of-phrase. In religious language: heaven
    or paradise, portrayed as a city in which God, his angels, and the
    beatified reside. Frequently in celestial city, heavenly city, etc.
    Cf. City of God n. at Phrases 1, Holy City n. at holy adj. and
    n. Compounds 2a.
-   4b. Something likened in some way to a city (sense 2). In later use:
    spec. an assembly or group of people, animals, or things likened to
    a city in being large in size or number.

Finally, we might briefly mentioned the enjambed "to-gether".
Etymologically, this follows the from the Old English "tógædere" with
"gædere" meaning something like gathering or companionship. The "we"
then is a vague and expansive collective, but it is also being thought
of as a political body, a group which is gathered and which can act as
such. (The enjambment reinforces that to be gathered is itself a sort of
activity).

"(of which there are four, & could be five)." {#sec:l20}
=============================================

Perhaps only in connection with the number five we might note the phrase
"cities of the plain,"

-   city of the plain n. \[after Hebrew ʿīr ha-kikkar (Genesis 13:12; \<
    ʿīr town, city + ha- the + kikkar plain, valley, oval-shaped
    district, specific sense development of kikkar round thing)\] any of
    the five biblical cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Zoar
    (or Bela), situated on the plain of Jordan and destroyed according
    to Genesis 19 because of the wickedness of the inhabitants. Also in
    extended use: any place notorious for depravity or corruption.

The question of what the cities are will continue to occupy us. The
final half of the poem transitions into a sort of travelogue,
approaching each city in terms. This progression itself is linked to the
proposal. We might then think of the piece as a whole as "a history of
the time standard in four (or five) cities". It is interesting that the
possibility of their being five cities is raised, as in the poem we do
not even reach the fourth city, the one in which we seem to come off the
time standard. There's this sense that we know so little as to what it
would be to come off the time standard that we cannot even say if there
would be anything beyond that.

One more thought about the cities: we usually understand them as a place
of residence, something more-or-less permanent. Yet if we are or have
been residents of these citizens (that is actually not made clear), we
are not permanent residents. The poem defines itself in opposition to
the idea of residence (more on which anon). If the numbers are the human
populace of the cities, it is not even clear that we number among them.

"This / *is* just a suggestion," {#sec:l20-l21}
================================

Obviously, the preliminariness of the proposal is importance, but the
repitition of the proposal adds a contrasting sense of earnest
enthusiasm. I will add that the italicized "*is*" is very KJV.

"set on the table to move / right out of range of those sickening and / greasy sureties" {#sec:l21-l23}
========================================================================================

"sureties" is likely used in the sense of "Subjective certainty on the
part of an individual; confidence, conviction. Cf. sureness n. 1a. Now
somewhat archaic." (OED, "surety," 5a) We'll try to decipher what kind
of surety is intended in a moment. We are told that these are "sickening
and greasy," and the tentativeness of the proposal is meant to contrast
with these certainties.

We should bring back the Troubles for a moment. One use of "greasy" is
"Anointed or 'smeared' with 'grease' or chrism. (A contemptuous term
applied to Roman Catholic priests in reference to unction.) *Obsolete*."
(OED, "greasy," 2) Is this a subtle anti-Catholic sentiment? This might
be troubling on the part of an English writer at the time, though I do
not think it is that exactly. Or better, to the extent that the
sentiment here is anti-Catholic it is not thereby in favor of English
imperialism. Rather, I take the proposal to be defined in contrast with
reactionary, religious "sureties." Howsoever sympathetic with
anti-colonial projects, given as ultimately we are aimed towards some
utopia (the fourth city) we should likewise be against (conceptually, if
not strategically) the traditional elements that might exist within
those projects.

We might correspondingly link the "greasy" to the (hypothetical) woman
to be (hypothetically) anointed: these sureties likewise represent a
reactionary counter-utopia, to which we cannot return (and which may not
have existed).

"like"back to our proper / homes\" (or look after the Golden Rose).\" {#sec:l23-24}
=====================================================================

I did not, unfortunately, find a source for "back to our proper homes"
or "look after the Golden Rose." I do not know whether or where these
phrases might have been used as slogans. We might think of "back to our
proper homes" as expressing a general reactionary sentiment. The retort
we can read the poem as implicitly making is that "our proper homes" do
not exist. This world is, after all, transitional (involving becoming
rather than being) and troubled. The only way through is out (off the
time standard).

"\[L\]ook after the Golden Rose" is more particular. The Golden Rose is
a crafted rose-shape golden object blessed on Rose Sunday in Lent and
distributed by the Pope (historically to European leaders, but also to
churches and shrines). "The beautiful Golden Rose symbolizes the Risen
Christ of glorious majesty." (Wikipedia, "The Golden Rose") It is this
that suggested the (Irish-)Catholic reading to the "sureties," though I
should admit that nowhere in Ireland had a Golden Rose until after the
publication date of the poem.

If anyone has a shout on these, I would appreciate this.
