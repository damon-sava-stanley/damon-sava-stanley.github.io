# A Weathered Mountain Isn't, Though It May Look Like, a Friend's Face

| Couldn't half hear the guide over
| the static, something about ---
|
| one plate can slip against
| another, falling, but when ---
|
| dunes and the oil lamp sputtered
| and sputtered but didn't --- Redwoods
|
| have a sandy grain so that you'd
| think the ocean --- *More ways to*
|
| *make a mess*, she said. *My life*
| *in a nutshell* --- means life and death.
|
| The path up --- bloodflow, sewage,
| a salty air --- refuse discharging.
| 
| Trash mountain. Don't say
| "hollowed out." ("Blasted.")

# A Theory of Constellations

| **Captain's Log** (Stardate: ???). Every lightyear
| you travel is another year before the sun
| burns out. From Canis Major it may be an eye
| of an undulating serpent: we do not know,
|
| not yet. The nightbreeze dragging the canopy
| as a boy tugs his sister's hair, sodium
| lights twinkled. Had some seminal matter
| dragged a yoctosecond, some white-hot, primordial
|
| *stuff* bubbled and yawned in the minutest
| divergence from history, Gemini might
| have wandered their separate ways, Castor carrying
|
| Phoebe to some private nebula. Messages take longer
| to reach base; some day, perhaps, the dove wings
| out into blankness and never returns.

# This Poem, Like Certain Fantasy Novels, Is Set On a Planet Beneath a Dying Sun

| and not on the mere technicality that all suns
| are dying suns. In the late autumn, children followed
| their fathers to the mine, pulling red wagons
|
| filled with leaves. There are deep shafts and
| a child may fall a clean six seconds if dropped straight.
| There are spumes in the ocean's floor supporting
|
| millennia of sulfurphages. In one of these novels,
| the surviving few build a great pyramid and live miles
| beneath its surface. In 1921, the mountains shield
|
| workers from allotted bombs, bearing red blooms
| on their broad backs, an angry red. The atmosphere,
| after all, is no thicker than a human throat,
|
| and the unplundered peaks, at last, accept
| the bomb-like sun with nothing like anger.
