Here are some worrying facts, for someone in the discipline, about academic philosophy.

1. White males are vastly overrepresented at all levels (and much more so than
   in other disciplines).
2. Non-white-males face more difficulties than otherwise being in, contributing
   to, and being recognized for their contributions.
3. The disciplinal response to the above has been slow and inadequate.

These I take to be well documented and fairly noncontroversial. What I want to
take up here is an interesting hypothesis proposed in @Berenstain2018 (who also
does an admirable job fleshing out the above three facts). In particular, she
seeks to explain one aspect of this last point: namely that philosophy as a
discipline has not properly enacted measures that, we have good evidence to
believe, counteract implicit biases (e.g. triple-blind review processes). These
measures are not implemented, Berenstain proposes, because those who are in a
position to implement them routinely underappreciate the existence and impacts
of implicit bias. Why is this underappreciated? Here is the interesting hypothesis. Because of a general commitment to a picture of the idealized rational self, which has the following four components.

> 1. Consistency --- the mind does not contain contradictory beliefs;
> 2. Unity --- the mind is simple; it does not have parts and is not
>    subdivided;
> 3. Rational transcendence --- in principle, thinkers are capable of achieving
>    an objective rationality that abstracts away from their contingent
>    circumstances and transcends cultural, environmental, and bodily
>    limitations on reasoning (e.g., exhaustion, hunger, and pain);
> 4. Introspective transparency --- the contents of one's mental states are
>    transparently available through introspection.

The claim in particular is that commitment to this picture has the following
effects.

> 1. It makes thinkers skeptical of the correct picture of implicit bias in
>    general.
> 2. It causes thinkers to be skeptical that they themselves are subject to
>    implicit bias and to underestimate the extent to which their judgments are
>    affected by it.

Here, I take it, are the ways adherence to this picture is supposed to have these effects.

1. If the mind is consistent, then if a person endorses egalitarian attitudes,
   she cannot also endorse (or even tacitly hold) inegalitarian biases. Since
   most philosophers (even the white, male ones) explicitly endorse some
   egalitarian attitude, they are not implicitly biased. In particular, since
   *I* endorse these attitudes, I cannot be implicitly biased.
2. Philosophers are, many (most) philosophers think, a highly rational lot.
   They form their (philosophical) beliefs, or at least *I* do, through
   rational methods---(pure) intuition, reflective equilibrium---that are safe
   from these sorts of biases. So even if other people are subject to bias,
   *we* are not.
3. *I* know what is going on in my head, and there ain't a racist or sexist
   thought or impulse there.

# Concerns

There is, I think, very likely something to this thought that philosophers are
especially likely to be overconfident in their estimation of their own
rationality. The question is whether this is explained by commitment to
something like the picture above. I am skeptical of this claim for the
following two reasons. First, I doubt that a commitment to this picture is in
fact all that widespread. Second, to the extent that it is, I do not expect it
to be a major cause of this overconfidence. Rather, I expect the explanation to
have more to do with the training and reward structure of the discipline
(philosophers are trained to and rewarded for what we might call public
displays of rationality and it strikes me as not implausible that someone
frequently praised for displaying rationality comes to overestimate and
overemphasize their own rationality, particularly if there are not robust
counterpressures in play). Of course all of these questions are empirical and
it seems we do not yet have adequate evidence.

Nevertheless, here are the worries. It is unclear how widespread adherence to
these tenets are. Certainly some are broadly held to *as ideals*, such as
rational transcendence. It would be somewhat unusual to think the ideal
rational agent would have racist or sexist attitudes. (This is an issue
Berenstain takes up at the end of the paper; put a pin in it.) But, it seems to
me, a widespread commitment to what we might call *ordinary irrationality*: in
general, everyone fails to live up to the ideals much of the time. As such,
philosophers have frequently been concerned with examining the sources of
error. For example, Descartes, who Berenstain credits (?) with exemplifying
"the most robust version of the idealized rational self conception," begins the
*Meditations* worrying how frequently he has been in error. Descartes'
explanation, moreover, for this error involves habitual inference [cf.
@Hatfield1992]. There is at least a major strain in the philosophy of mind that
thinks of ordinary mental goings-on as subdoxastic, arational [implicit bias
itself has come in for some philosophical attention, cf. @Brownstein2015]. I
think it is at best unclear the extent to which philosophers are committed to a
picture of the mind incompatible with the existence of implicit bias.^[The
evidence Berenstain adduces here, for example the literature surrounding
Kripke's puzzle, seems far from telling.]

I expect it more likely that philosophers are by and large are committed to a
picture of cognitive functioning that is at least compatible with the existence
of implicit biases. It is almost certainly true that the broad picture of
ideal, rational cognitive function is incompatible with the existence (or at
least the efficaciousness) of implicit biases (unpin this point). The wise
person, as Hume tells us, apportions their beliefs to their evidence.
Correspondingly, they act on and only on what their reasons support. So the
ideally rational person does not suffer from implicit biases, or, if they do,
they never let them effect their beliefs or actions.

Is that not what we should want? After all, implicit biases are supposed to be
bad things: distortions that cause us to act unjustly. If our picture of
rationality tells us not to have or not to be effected by such biases, so much
the better, it seems, for this picture. Here, though, is the worry. For an
analogy, think a moment about virtue ethics. What I should do, a simple version
of virtue ethics tells me, is to do what the virtuous person would do. Suppose
I have wronged a friend in some way and start thinking about how to make it
right with them. I ask myself what the virtuous person would do. *What she
would have done*, a voice snaps back, *is not get herself in this situation*.
What we wanted to know is what to do in the face of our inevitable deviation
from virtue. Likewise, what we want to know is what to do in the face of our
inevitable irrationality.

Fair enough, one wants to reply, these ideal theories do not always tell us
what to do, do not provide direct guidance. But they do provide an indirect
guidance: they tell us what to aim for. We are to try to be, to the greatest
extent possible, the person who does not wrong her friends, or does not suffer
from biases. We will have to depart from ideal theories, do some nonideal theorizing, to figure out exactly what that involves, but these projects are not incompatible, indeed, are, instead, complementary.

But Berenstain, following @Mills2005' related complaints against ideal
political theory, thinks this picture is far too rosy. There are a cluster of
complaints here, and I admit to not always having a great sense of all of them.

1. Ideal theories are wastes of time. Nonideal theorizing is both independent
   and much more important.
2. Ideal theories are actively misleading. They obscure, rather than
   illuminate, thinking about what subjects who suffer from cognitive biases,
   moral failings, and live in systematically unjust worlds.
3. Ideal theories themselves are the result of, expressions of white, male
   supremacy. ("Like the non-racialized conception of the social contract, the
   idealized rational self is an idealizing abstraction that, while once
   explicitly racialized and gendered, now purports to be genderless and
   raceless.")

As Berenstain elaborates it, this third point seems to reduce to the second.^[I
want to note in passing that the historical claim that the idealized rational
self was once explicitly racialized and gendered may be too quick. As
@Smith2015 reveals, the moderns had a diversity of perspectives on race that,
while overall troubling, included more egalitarian currents. Descartes, for
instance, seems to have included black people under the rubric of this self.]
The problem there is a "conceptual sleight of hand that moves from a
purportedly normative context to a descriptive one without acknowledging that
such a shift has taken place." This is, however, a user error rather than a
real implication of the theory itself. 

I think this last point poses some problems for Berenstain's explanation and so
is worth foregrounding. If the explanation for an underappreciation of implicit
bias resulting from a commitment to a theory comes itself from a fallacious
inference from the theory, then why think the commitment to this theory itself
is what is doing the explanatory work? Surely white, male philosophers could be
committed to a nonideal, arational picture of the self and make largely the
same fallacious inferences. We could be, instead, committed Freudians,
explaining everything in terms of the sex and death drives and thinking that,
well, since I rejected that candidate out of a brute, incestuous desire, I
could not have rejected her out of an implicit bias against women of color.

I am sympathetic to Mills' problems with ideal political theory. It is
plausible to me that the questions ideal political theory asks are misguided
and uninteresting and distract from and perhaps distort a more grounded
approach to injustice [cf. @Gaus2016 for a convincing treatment]. It is less
plausible to me that thinking about ideal rationality is similarly pointless or
similarly harmful.

# Conclusion

In the end, I agree with Berenstain's recommendations. Even without having a
robust understanding of the causes of these problems in the discipline,
sensible steps can be taken towards their solution. Many of these
recommendations (e.g. in the [APA's Good Practices
Guide](https://www.apaonline.org/page/goodpracticesguide))---blind reviewing
practices, anonymity in grading, being more deliberate and less intuitive in
one's professional evaluations, e.g. in hiring, and so on---are relatively low
cost and low risk.^[This is not a thoroughgoing endorsement of all
recommendations given in the guide or elsewhere. For instance, the APA guide,
admittedly qualifiedly, endorses [Project
Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/), despite its measurements
being controversial and, likely, [largely
meaningless](https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html).]
It is certainly also worth investigating these causes. I doubt, however, that
this has all that much to do with philosophers' theoretical commitments, rather
than, say, cultural aspects of the discipline.
