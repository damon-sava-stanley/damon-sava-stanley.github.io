title: "Earth 2: a Beautiful Con"

A good con is a beautiful thing. The conman can cut an attractive figure --- Victor Lustig "The Man Who Sold the Eiffel Tower Twice" is the subject of at least half a dozen books, one for children, and was described "as elusive as a puff of cigarette smoke and as charming as a young girl's dream" [@mayshManWhoSold2016] --- and the conned too provide their own pleasures. We can watch them as we watch the horror character investigating the strange rustling in the dark woods, sympathetic and superior, sure we would be savvy enough to avoid their unfortunate end. Indeed, many con victims do not even admit they have been conned (the man Lustig "sold" the Eiffel Tower to never came forward). Indeed, from an external perspective confidence schemes are win-win. After all, if the scheme fails we get the pleasure of justice being served. (The YouTube channel "[Scammer Payback](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC9EjyMN_hx5NdctLBx5X7w)" produces videos of the channel owner tricking scammers into harming themselves. Their most popular video "[Scammer BEGS for His Deleted Files As I Drink His Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq8cKjdNpCo)" currently has four-and-a-half million views.)

A good con is memorable: the mark should not be able to get the con out of their head. As Pascal Boyer has suggested, an idea is most memorable when it is minimally counterintuitive: it is an idea that we do not expect, but we accept after it is introduced. Take Lustig's sale of the Eiffel Tower: that an official would be selling the Eiffel Tower on the cheap in an unofficial capacity is surprising, but after we hear the explanation that he is trying to get a bribe, we can accept it. Or take the Lustig's "money box:" a box that is "shown" to print hundred dollar bills (just two bills running through) that Lustig would sell just before embarking on a ocean voyage. Again, it is surprising that someone would have such a box, and that they would have the box and be trying to offload it, but there is a ready explanation: they are a counterfeiter about to embark on a voyage which would make the counterfeiting device useless to them.

In this way, Lustig's "money box" is the real equivalent of Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Bottle Imp" (1891). In that story, a magic bottle contains an imp that, when bought, grants wishes (other than immortality). If not sold before the owner's death, they will be damned to hell, and, crucially, the device must be sold for less than it was bought. You can see the catch: as the bottle gets cheaper it becomes harder to sell. One has to answer the question the money box also raises: why such a steal? Why is something so immensely valuable being more or less given away. There is another catch with the bottle: it does not make sense to buy it for very cheap. If you buy it for one cent, there is no way to sell it (part of the rules is that it cannot be bought for a fraction of a cent) and so you are damned to hell. If you buy it for two cents, well you would have to sell it for one cent, but as we have just seen no reasonable person would buy it for one cent. A similar story goes for three cents and it seems it would go on forever, so that it never makes sense to buy the bottle, despite its wish-granting powers.

In the story, this antinomy is solved by the ultimate mark: a sinner agrees to buy the imp from the protagonist for two cents as an act of generosity and on the assumption that he was damned to hell anyway. In the pure speculative investment we see the reverse of the Bottle Imp. Take the following variation on the story: the bottle contains no imp, grants no wishes, and each owner needs to sell the bottle for more than they bought it. Here the mark becomes not the *deux ex machina* but an *idÃ©e  fixe*: each buyer of the bottle does so precisely because they are convinced that there is another mark out there. At each transaction the stakes get higher and so the marks more elusive. But there is also the allure of the minimally counterintuitive: the commodity which has no value, but which can be profitably traded precisely for that reason. It is just such a commodity that Earth 2 offers.

# Earth 2

What is Earth 2? It is not immediately clear. Here is the [company's pitch](https://earth2.io/)

> Earth 2 is a futuristic concept for a second earth; a metaverse, between
> virtual and physical reality in which real-world geolocations on a sectioned
> map correspond to user generated digital virtual environments. These
> environments can be owned, bought, sold, and in the near future deeply
> customized.

We have two related components: there's the "metaverse," Earth 2's copy cites the virtual second worlds of *Snow Crash* and *Ready Player One* as inspiration. Yet Earth 2 is not a virtual second world, although it advertises that it will someday become one; really it is a marketplace for a virtual asset: digital land. Earth 2 thus has two competing promises: it will be an immersive virtual-reality game someday, but it is an investment opportunity right now. 

This duality is reflected all over their communication. On their home page, an impressive graphic shows a second Earth budding off the first one, but even above this a ticker shows the latest plots to be sold and the amount they have appreciated in value: seven-thousand, ten-thousand, no, twenty-thousand percent appreciation! 

Earth 2 is a new company. It could possibly take off, certainly users are even now putting down good money, the [leaderboard](https://app.earth2.io/#leaderboards) listing users who own plots of land in Earth 2 worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, but for any scam on the Internet, there is plenty of competition. And it looks like the supply of new marks Earth 2 needs is drying off. Even though it likely will not last, Earth 2 is an interesting phenomenon. In this essay, I propose to contextualize this phenomenon, to explain where it came from, where it is situated in a context of similar schemes, and why anyone would fall for it.

# Cyberpunk and the Frontier of the Internet

Earth 2 describes itself as a metaverse, an idea it credits to *Snow Crash* (which coined the term) and *Ready Player One*. Examining these sources reveals the hollow promise of Earth 2's virtual frontier. This is a place that American culture has been before, both in the electronic frontier of the early Internet but also with it's physical frontier, the Wild West. In both cases, it faced the same problem, the promise of freedom and rugged individualism embodied in the mythic figures of the prospector and the hacker in quickly gave way to a reality of corporate ownership enriching itself by selling this fantasy. Of course, this is exactly what Earth 2 hopes to do. 

Turner's seminal essay "The Significance of the Frontier in American History" claimed the existence of the frontier as "the distinguishing feature of American life."[@turnerFrontierAmericanHistory1921 2] The frontier carried the promise and sometimes the actuality of making it and of making it on one's lonesome, a promise felt with varying fervor from the Louisiana purchase to the complete settling of the frontier by the eighteen-eighties: modestly in the case of homesteaders looking to raise a farm and family on freely-provided federal land, fervently in the case of prospectors. 

[TODO: Spruce/cite this bit up] Despite cultural myths of prospectors as rugged individuals trying their luck, most miners worked in the employ of corporations,[@jungCapitalismComesDiggings1998] and the windfalls of the Gold Rush went by and large to the owners of these corporations (the Guggenheims of the world)[@robbinsColonyEmpireCapitalist1994] while individual miners labored in extremely hazardous conditions.[@kornbergMiseryMiningOld2009]

Still, the myth of the western frontier penetrates deep into the western psyche, so it is not surprising that the metaphor was applied to the early Internet (e.g. in Howard Rheingold's *The Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier*).[Cf. @adamsCyberspaceVirtualPlaces1997] Indeed, it fits the Internet, at least in its incipiency, perhaps better than it ever fit the historical Wild West. Since it was not initially clear how the web could be monotized, it took a while for the corporations to arrive, and when they did they did their best to blend in: Yahoo with Yahoo! Pipes (now defunct) allowed users to create their own websites by remixing RSS feeds, Twitter bots are likewise a shadow of the freedom originally promised, and reddit launched open source but of course is no longer. In the meantime, the web had its own lawmen,[@lookLawOrderWild2001] its own ghost towns (R.I.P. Geocities), its own booms and busts (current residents of San Francisco may remember wistfully that in 2001, after the Dot-Com Bubble burst, rent prices fell by a third).[@taylorManyLivesNew2004]

A forgotten aspect of the early Internet is the importance of VR in the digital imaginary. Only three years after the standardization of HTML (hyper text markup language), virtual reality markup language (VRML) was introduced. There has been renewed [recent interest](https://steantycip.com/blogs/future-of-retail-is-virtual/) for the possibilities of VR shopping, but the possibility of virtual reality in retail dated back to the beginning of the Internet. In 1995, Kevin Hughes laid out the path *From Webspace to Cyberspace*, which envisions the Internet as host to public worlds, virtual reality spaces.  [TODO cite and expand]

Virtual reality, and in particular virtual reality as a shared social space, has existed for much longer in the imagination of science fiction authors. For instance, E. M. Forster's 1909 story "The Machine Stops" imagines a dystopic society whose members live by "The Machine," pressing it buttons to fulfill their needs, to communicate with their friends, and to conjure up images. This is an early model of something like the Internet, if not quite yet VR, which would have to wait for Weinbaum's 1935 "Pygmalion's Spectacles." The term "cyberspace" appears in William Gibson's 1982 "Burning Chrome," and later *Neuromancer*. In these early Gibson works, cyberspace is a scape from "The Sprawl," an urban mega-city and a capitalist hell-scape.

By the time of Stephenson's 1995 *Snow Crash*, these cyberpunk tropes, largely established by Gibson's work, had become so well-worn as to be the site of parody. *Snow Crash*'s protagonist, Hiro Protagonist, was an early contributor to the metaverse, basically cyberspace, at least until corporations took it over. A clear theme of the novel is that virtual space will inherit all of the issues and inequities of the real world: in reality, the poor live in shipping containers owned by corporations; in the metaverse, the poor are stuck with free avatars, unattractive and monochrome, excluded from the metaverse's private clubs. *Ready Player One*, Earth 2's other cited influence, advances this idea by having the metaverse corporately owned from the very beginning.

Taking the ideas of Earth 2's own cited inspiration, we can see that this space is already a marked as a site of economic injustice. The marketing may want us to forget these implications, to buy into the myths of the pioneer (just as early enthusiasts of the web in their utopic fervor ignored the dystopic cynicism of the science fiction visions they sought to realize), but they carry along with themselves the specter of corporate power selling a vision of freedom and self-sufficiency and exploiting those willing to fall for this vision.

# Is It a Con? Is It a Game? No... It's Both!

Though of course I cannot say with absolute certainty, I would put very long odds against the metaverse Earth 2 promises ever existing. Game development offers us an inglorious history of over-hype. Before providing context, we will talk a bit about Earth 2 as a game. Of course the currently existing software can scarcely be called a game. In this connection, the following [FAQ](https://earth2.io/https:/earth2.io/faq) is revealing.

> **What is the purpose of buying virtual land? Is it just to be able to say "I
> claimed this!"? Is there more to this "game" than spending money on a plot of

>
> There will be numerous purposes to buying land, too many to list, but to give

So the current "game" is just a marketplace for "Virtual Land," ten-by-ten meter plots (corresponding to real locations on Earth!) that start at a base price of ten virtual cents each. Transactions in Earth 2 are carried out in virtual currency. To their credit, unlike other exploitative games, these fun-bucks correspond one-to-one with US dollars. To their demerit, cashing out involves emailing a whole bunch of personal details to Earth 2 and the wait for cashing out already takes months. Though when you think about it, this is generosity on their part; their Terms and Conditions do not require them to allow you to withdraw.[^toc] Not to worry, though, this is just Phase 1! In Phase 2 (Q2 2021), these plots will generate resources. (These may even be based on resources generated by the corresponding real locations! No promises though.) And before you ask, of course you can buy and sell resources on the market place, silly.

[^toc]: The Earth 2 [terms and conditions](https://earth2.io/terms) include
   lots of fun clauses. Here's the relevant one.

    > **Limitation of liability**
    > 
    > Except as expressly set out in these Website terms or to the extent
    > required by non-excludable law, we are not liable for any loss or damage,
    > however caused (including, but not limited to, by our negligence)
    > suffered by you in connection with these Website terms of use or your use
    > of this Website (even as a registered member).
    > 
    > If the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any other legislation
    > states that there is a guarantee in respect of goods or services
    > supplied, and our liability for breach of that guarantee may not be
    > excluded but may be limited, our liability for such breach is limited to,
    > in the case of a supply of goods, replacing the goods or supplying
    > equivalent goods or repairing the goods, or in the case of supply of
    > services, supplying the services again or paying the cost of having the
    > services supplied again.

   **Read**: we do not have to give you anything for the fun bucks you bought. If the court disagrees with this, we can compensate you in more company scrip.

By Phase 3 (no date set), there will even be something resembling a game: the terrain of Earth 2 will be generated and traversable. We even have been provided a [vision of what this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6Q07TXpjo8). If you watched the video and concluded that this was just a camera panning through hundred dollars or so of store-bought Unity assets ([e.g.](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/mountain-trees-dynamic-nature-107004)), a sky-box, a cheap temp track, and a pan-out courtesy of Google Earth, well, shame on you for your cynicism. Especially reassuring is the text "In Game Footage," as we know, [no game company has ever falsely advertised a trailer as in game footage](https://gamerant.com/aliens-colonial-marines-trailers-false-advertising/). If you are wondering whether your old potato could possibly handle something so detailed and immersive, well, not to worry, a [very professional accompanying document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KWRp9ESIu5q9tvd1dxYrR2Ml3idCnGoC/view) reassures us that "all kinds of innovations" have been employed in optimizing this quote-unquote game: such innovations as down-sampling and draw distances.

Even in this incipient state, there is strategy in this non-game: investment strategy. Currently, with no resources, nothing makes one plot inherently worth more than any other. Though the strategic, long-term thinkers that populate the social media around Earth 2 are already thinking in terms of Phase 2, Phase 3, and beyond, considering, e.g., the tourist value of the plots. Mostly, though, the strategic thinking of players involves buying where other players are buying and hoping to get early on the bandwagon. For instance, upon entering the discord, I was kindly messaged by a user recommending that I invest in plots belonging to a megacity in north Macedonia. The brilliance of a pyramid scheme, which I bring up for no reason at all, is that it makes fluid the distinction between the con artist and mark: every mark can become the artist if only they can find enough marks for themself. 

What motivates my certainty that Earth 2, in addition to not being a game, will never be a game? After all, the company has seven (7) entire developers, a magical number. The closest predecessor to Earth 2 is *Star Citizen*. A quick summary for those not in the know. *Star Citizen* is (?) an ambitious space simulator. Better, *Star Citizen* is an alpha release for a possible ambitious space simulator, and it only cost near four-hundred million dollars and a decade to get there. *Star Citizen* started development in 2011 and launched a Kickstarter campaign in 2012, raising two million dollars. Since then it just kept crowdfunding via the sale of ships, some for tens of thousands of dollars.

Now, I would call *Star Citizen* a scam, except that doing so has proven to lead to death threats. It turns out that the sort of person who is willing to spend huge amounts of money on a game that they cannot even play is not the sort of person to respond rationally to criticism. What *Star Citizen* proved more than any other game is that the fantasy of a video game, properly packaged, can be more valuable than any real video game, and, further, the best salespeople of your video game are the players. Well, not players exactly, but investors. Well, not players exactly, but marks. Then again, you're only a mark if you haven't marked anyone else.

Which reminds me, I've got some land in Macedonia that I think will make a great investment. Be sure to use my referral code, and I'll get you a five, no ten, no fifteen percent discount.

# Earth 2 Should Run on Ethereum

To be fair to *Star Citizen*, I am somewhat more confident that its developers intended (and perhaps still intend) to release a video game than I am that those of Earth 2 ever did, if only because the business strategy of not releasing a video game did not exist until *Star Citizen* invented it. Since Earth 2 is not and may never be a game, it is better contextualized in terms of its direct competition.

In the space of virtual lands that can be bought and vaguely, somehow monetized, there are a pre-existing players: *Decentraland*, *Axie Infinity*, *Sandbox*, *Evolution Land*. All of these predate Earth 2 by two-to-three years, all of them are actually games, of some description, and, crucially, all of them are based on the cryptocurrency Ethereum. 

A quick primer. A currency is just a system for assigning numbers to accounts (which are often associated with individuals) with controlled mechanisms for reassigning those numbers: I can transfer some of my numbers to your account but I cannot just magic some numbers into my account. If the currency is weights of gold, that control is effected by physical facts about gold: I can give you some of my gold, but it's hard to just make new gold. With a modern fiat currency, those accounts and rules are controlled and enforced by banks. In a cryptocurrency, those accounts and rules are controlled and enforced by a distributed ledger (typically based on a blockchain).

Bitcoin is the best known of these cryptocurrencies. Ethereum advances on Bitcoin by adding special accounts, contracts, not controlled by individuals but by programs which the ledger itself executes. These contracts themselves can be created (and created by other contracts) and assigned to accounts. Hence, you can create contracts of a kind, assign some number of these to an account and transfer them between accounts, i.e. you can build your own cryptocurrency on top of Ethereum. That's what these games do: they have their various fun bucks and items which can be traded by users through the Ethereum ledger.

Why would anyone care about this? There's a slight philosophical point. When you own a digital asset --- you buy a cool ship in *Star Citizen* or your employer puts some cool greenbacks in your checking account --- your continued ownership of that asset is outside of your control. *Star Citizen* could just delete the line in their database (maybe even by accident) or the bank could just ask themself "That person had zero dollars in their account? No, maybe, actually, I think they owed us money." And there would be nothing stopping them; well, laws and stuff, but then you have to trust the government. But if that cool *Star Citizen* ship was an Ethereum contract, you could buy it and then all the computers sharing the Ethereum ledger would all agree that you owned that ship and there is nothing anyone could do about it.

The problem with this line of thinking is that although you might have gone some distance to ensure the fact of your ownership of this asset, you have not ensured the usability of this ownership. The asset, as nothing more than a shared record, is all exchange value and there is no guarantee of it being exchangeable for anything. *Star Citizen* could remove that cool ship from their game (or, more realistically, never put it in) and the fact of your ownership would be worth exactly squat. You are still at much at the mercy of outside systems as ever. Meanwhile, what this pointless reassurance has cost you is the use of Ethereum, where transactions are slow and expensive.

Still, there is a kind of person who is excited by cryptocurrencies --- and there is a certain intellectual appeal. That kind of person is also the kind of person who is excited to put their cryptocurrency to use in owning a piece of virtual land in a sub-par game. (To be fair, what else are you going to do with your ether?) There is significant overlap between this demographic and investors in Earth 2, so much so that a common request on their subreddit and discord is converting the Earth 2 marketplace to a similar Ethereum affair. The developers of Earth 2 have so far refused to take this option. That they have considered it is evidenced by this paragraph in the Terms and Conditions.

> We reserve the right in the future to convert your holding of Virtual Land
> (or any equivalent credits held in the Earth 2 platform) to an equivalent
> value of a crypto-currency that we may create in the future. Any conversion
> would be conducted at a valuation reasonably determined by us.

Now, as you might have expected, cryptocurrencies are fishy and lend themselves to cons just in the same way Earth 2 does. Despite the name, no cryptocurrency has really succeeded as a medium for exchange. Rather, they are by and large entirely speculative assets. What makes an asset function as a currency rather than an investment?

1. Holders of that asset sometimes need to exchange it for some good. (As an important and common case, citizens need to exchange their money in exchange for the government's promise not to imprison them for tax violation.)
2. Holders of that asset can exchange it for goods.
3. That asset is a bad investment: it does not meaningfully appreciate in value.

All cryptocurrencies fail at least one of these tests. Bitcoin got closest: it was needed for some illegal exchanges (where the anonymity of its transactions overrode its weakness as a medium for exchange), it could be exchanged for some goods (though any smart vendor that accepted Bitcoin did so by working with a service that would immediately trade it for dollars; furthermore the blockchain is such that Bitcoin can never be the basis of high-volume trading), but because Bitcoin is deflationary by design, a stupefyingly bad choice, it made an attractive investment.

All fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, and Earth 2 plots (and later resources) share a common feature: they, by design, have no use value. With a fiat currency, there is at least a government ensuring that some circulation of the currency takes place: taking out currency through taxes and paying its employees in that currency. Earth 2 plots were not designed as a currency: unlike Bitcoins different plots are worth different amounts. Still, they share essential features, including an in-built deflationary mechanism: there are only so many plots and when a plot is bought, surrounding plots rise in value. This ensures that there is some point to trading with other users rather than just buying new land.

The key shared heritage between cryptocurrencies and Earth 2 is that you have a useless asset and a fantasy. Indeed, the fantasies share a common lineage in cyberpunk, the metaverse and the untraceable crypto-hackers. In fairness to cryptocurrencies, they can actually deliver on something of their fantasy --- a blockchain does provide for anonymous, distributed ledgers --- which can explain some small portion of their value. Bitcoin is a neat piece of technology supporting something that is not a functional currency. The fantasy of Earth 2 will never be realized: it is nothing supporting nothing. 

# To the Moon 2!

The last focused comment, before we get really broad and philosophical, is on the culture surrounding Earth 2. It is fairly familiar to other parts of the trading net, what we might call meme traders. It is a melange of users earnestly "hustling," trying to get others on board, and more detached users. The former class is in part motivated by Earth 2's referral system (get other people on board and get 5% of the fun bucks they purchase) and in part by the hope of getting marks to sell to. As mentioned, selling among users is driven in large part by the banding together to create mega-cities, blocks of attached plots. Many of these proposals are driven by their meme potential, e.g. a recreation of the chad meme in Chad (Earth 2 plots can be bought in the name of different countries upon which the corresponding flag can be placed, permitting primitive pixel art).

![Or, for the cultured among you.](images/earth2/420.png)

There is a label that arose to describe the behavior of certain users of online forums: *SchrÃ¶dinger's Douchebag*. SchrÃ¶dinger's Douchebag is a person who says something offensive and decides whether they were serious by other's reaction. This is especially common in anonymous forums where there is no social cost to offending someone else. In trading communities, like especially the subreddit forum WallStreetBets, you have a similar phenomenon: SchrÃ¶dinger's Proposition. SchrÃ¶dinger's Proposition is a proposal which was made in earnest only if it is well received. So I can propose that me and other members of the discord serve build chad in Chad: if they do not play along, it was of course a joke, and if they show uptake, I meant it. And of course SchrÃ¶dinger's Proposition can be met with another SchrÃ¶dinger's Proposition. I  might respond with a rocket ship emoji to your proposal to build chad in Chad, suggesting my approval, but if other people don't like it, well it would be silly to take my emoji in earnest.

![And of course.](images/ElonMusk.png)

Such communicative strategies naturally arise around any risky communication. The case of commitments to trade fall under a broader category of collective deliberation. Take, for example, flirtation: the blunt approach to arranging romance is potentially socially costly. Indeed, if, for example, that desired romance is homosexual in a sufficiently homophobic society, it can be dangerous. Flirtation provides a level of plausible deniability: if the advances are unwanted, well it is easy enough to believe, or at least pretend, that they were never made. 

![Indeed, Earth 2 has its equivalent of the blunt, desperate proposition: the posting of a referral code.](images/earth2/Referral.png)

This, at least, describes users still in the honeymoon phase. Given that the user base has grown to 250,000 users from its launch in November 2020 to February 2021 but has since, it seems, more or less stalled, with the marketplace flatlining, the opportunity to take the virtual land to the moon and make a quick buck has likewise passed. This had led to the admixture into the social media of [skeptics](https://www.reddit.com/r/earth2io/comments/lngxzj/my_honest_and_brutal_thoughts_on_e2/) and quiet resignation: perhaps they will maybe make a game out of this in the end, or if I lost, it was only an amount comfortable losing.

# Digital Prospecting and the Homesteading Fantasy

The language of the confidence scheme is very natural in application to Earth 2: in particular Earth 2 has the form of a Ponzi scheme. Of course, this suggests a confidence artist, someone intentionally running the scheme. It is of course difficult to say what the leaders of Earth 2 really intended. I have been writing under the assumption that they are grounded enough to know that Phase 3 will not ever happen. But then business leaders are not known for being grounded: their real job is not to lead but to fantasize and to sell their fantasies. So it may be just as Adam Neumann, for example, managed to convince investors that a real estate company being run as a tech startup (massive unprofitability) was some brilliant opportunity and seemed himself to believe it, Isaac Shane, CEO of Earth 2, believes that the metaverse really can be build by half a dozen developers. 

Still, though I cannot prove it, it's hard to imagine that the leadership do not at some level understand what they are doing. There is the fact that Earth 2's copy has been changed in ways that shall we say de-emphasize the appearance of a Ponzi scheme, as pointed out by [this reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/earth2io/comments/lm0ish/subtle_changes_to_earth2io_site_shows_the/). For instance the following passage existed [on December 27, 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201227131441if_/https://earth2.io/how-to-make-money) but no longer does.

> The price of land inside Earth 2 fluctuates from country to country. Each
> country starts at the very attractive price of $0.10 for 10mx10m of land.
> The value changes depending on trading price and demand per country giving
> you potential opportunities to buy low and sell high.
>
> This trading platform is available and operation right now and is a potential
> way for early buyers to earn big returns on their land purchases.

Really though, it is not of much importance whether Earth 2 is an incredibly half-baked concept using, in effect, a Ponzi scheme as a funding mechanism or just a straight Ponzi scheme. In the grand scheme of things, though, this is not a remarkably big scheme --- several orders of magnitude below Bernie Madoff's $60 billion --- and it is likely not to get much bigger.

I have made the case for Earth 2's aesthetic appeal. On the one hand, it is the appeal of the scheme, the gimmick that will make us rich because other people will fall for it after us. Social media has produced the community of the investment gimmick, a whole subculture that engages in flirtatious, jokey organization. On the other, the promised game taps into a deep American fantasy, the frontier: a place of self-ownership, self-definition.

Both fantasies, I think, are especially potent in the present moment. There is a direct comparison to Earth 2 we have not yet touched: Earth 1. Land, real land, to any reasonable observer belongs to a scheme more complex and more damaging than any Earth 2 could pull. After all, if a scheme manipulates the price of something in itself worthless, a plot of virtual land, there is at least a way of insulating oneself from the scheme: do not buy virtual land. When the scheme targets something of real value, land and the housing built on it,
