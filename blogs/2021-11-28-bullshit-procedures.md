In 1545, the vineyards of St. Julien were ravaged by green weevils. The wine-growers beseeched the local authority for relief, upon which the green weevils were put on trial. The trial ended inconclusively, with the weevils unsentenced and a treatment proscribed not pesticidal but spiritual: the wine-growers were to engage in public prayer and pay tithes in order to propitiate the divine wrath that surely sent the weevils upon them in the first place. This incident and its sequel are described in Edmund Evans' 1906 book [*The Criminal Prosecution and Capital Punishment of Animals*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/43286/43286-h/43286-h.htm#Page_342) (38--50). Evans argues that such animal trials served not any proper purpose of legal or social morality but were instead instruments of political domination.

> [The trial] was the product of a social state, in which dense ignorance was governed by brute force, and is not to be considered as a reaction and protest against club-law, which it really tended to foster by making a travesty of the administration of justice and thus turning it into ridicule. It was also in the interest of ecclesiastical dignities to keep up this parody and perversion of a sacred and fundamental institute of civil society, since it strengthened their influence and extended their authority by subjecting even the caterpillar and the canker-worm to their dominion and control.
