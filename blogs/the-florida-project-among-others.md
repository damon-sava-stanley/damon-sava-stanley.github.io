*The Florida Project*, Sean Baker's 2017 film, reveals a tension between a
liberal project and a project of moral desert. These are broad tents; so let
us narrow down the terrain.^[For overviews of these see [@SEPLiberalism;
@SEPRetributiveJustice].] The liberal project I have in mind is of a Rawlsian,
egalitarian project, one whose theory thinks of a just society as requiring
some sort of fair distribution of resources while maintaining a traditional
liberal commitment to the individual's political liberty as an essential good.
This set of normative doctrines bears on the fundamental goals of our
political institutions and political lives, but maintains general silence on
how individuals ought to live. The liberal project then is an attempt at
implementing this theory. Similarly, the sort of theory of moral desert I am
thinking of here consists

 1. a theory on which there are moral responsibility facts (e.g. Lisa was 
    blameworthy for stealing April's lunch but praiseworthy for owning up to it),
 2. connections between claims about moral responsibility and claims about desert
    (e.g. Lisa deserves to be sent to detention because she is blameworthy for
    stealing April's lunch), and
 3. connections between claims about desert and what individuals ought to do
    (e.g. the teacher ought to send Lisa to detention because she deserves it).

Like liberalism, this is more schema than theory, one that both retributive
and restorative justice can slot into. Both of these projects have serious
intellectual and political currencies.^[As a piece of evidence, according to
the [Philpapers Survey](https://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl), around
three-quarters of philosophers accept some version of realism about moral
responsibility and a plurality accept egalitarianism.] But in both realms
they do not interact neatly.
