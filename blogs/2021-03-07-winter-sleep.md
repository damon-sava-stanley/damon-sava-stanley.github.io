# Winter Sleep

::: verse
* |    *Luke 19:11*
* <br/>
* | Wheat threshed, casks of cherries, plums,
* | boiled melon, beef tallow, pig bladders blown
* | and tossed by children, mothers stirring stock,
* | kidneys, hearts pressed with aspic,
* <br/>
* | casings scraped and stuffed, allspice, cloves.
* | Fields bare, packed clay, porcelain sheen,
* | the long winter sleep. In my dream,
* | I wake and the village is empty.
* <br/>
* | coal smolderning, acacia shadows on snow.
* | Second sons, sow thistle, the first to go.
* | In my dream, I wake to chaff and dust,
* | a war lost, harvest thrown down,
* <br/>
* | grain scattered on the temple floor.
* | In my dream, I wake hungry, an ocean away
* | in a hut hollowed out of the side of a hill, Black Sea
* | salt in my mouth. Wild onion, sage,
* <br/>
* | hawkweed, prickly rose, plowed
* | dirt worked thin as smoke, poplar scrub
* | felled and bucked into windows to make way for
* | electric blooms, Monsanto Roundup Ready canola.
* <br/>
* | What we had wasn't enough. Silk, balsam,
* | communal granaries full. We were told to take
* | what the master had given us and multiply it tenfold.
* | In my dream, I wake in the attic bedroom
* <br/>
* | of a mail-order farmhous. A hundred and sixty acres seeded
* | in barley and oats. A few brood hens, five head of cattle,
* | three-hitch binder, a trotter, two heavy horses. We were told
* | to take what we did not lay down, reap what we did not sow.
* <br/>
* | I wake to 6,000 acres, high-clearance sprayers
* | with 140-foot booms. Sulfur, phosphorous, nitrogen, potash.
* | Harvest done by drone. Yields monitored, data downloaded
* | into $750,000 air seeders come spring. We were told---
* <br/>
* | to those who have, more will be given.
* | Viterra's actuaries betting on futures markets,
* | brokering grain they don't own. We were told
* | those with nothing, even that will be taken away.
* <br/>
* | Just look at those who stayed---
* | in my dream, the men from Grunau, found
* | heads down, shoulder to shoulder, tongues
* | nailed to the dining table.
* <br/>
* | Or Alex Saretzky from Tiegenort,
* | blood pouring from his wrists, hands cut off
* | by Makhnovists requisitioning his cattle.
* | In my dream we tell these stories
* <br/>
* | to our babies in their cradles.
* | The lesson of the parable? What good is your labor
* | if the fruit doesn't grow and grow and grow?
* | I wake in the hip-roof barn,
* <br/>
* | and where we hang the throat-cut animal,
* | men dangle. Hailstorm, flood, drought.
* | Interest rates. Debt loads. Go big, or
* | get out.
