  abstract = {In this paper, I will focus on a type of confabulation that emerges in relation to questions about mental attitudes (e.g. belief, emotion, decision) whose causes we cannot introspectively access. I argue against two popular views that see confabulations as mainly offering a psychological story about ourselves. On these views, confabulations are the result of either a cause-tracking mechanism or a self-directed mindreading mechanism. In contrast, I propose the view that confabulations are mostly telling a normative story: they are arguments primarily offered to justify one's attitudes, and they are produced by our argumentative reasoning mechanism driven by the biological goal of presenting ourselves as good reasoners and as reliable sources of information.},

  publisher = {{Routledge}},

  abstract = {In a recent poll of practicing art critics,~75 percent reported that rendering judgments on artworks was the least significant aspect of their job. This is a~troubling statistic for philosopher and critic Noel Carroll, who argues that that the proper task of the critic is not simply to describe, or to uncover hidden meanings or agendas, but~instead~to determine what is of value in art.  Carroll argues for a humanistic conception of criticism which focuses on what the artist has achieved by creating or performing the work. Whilst a good critic should not neglect to contextualize and offer interpretations of a work of art, he argues that too much recent criticism has ignored the fundamental role of the artist's intentions.  Including examples from visual, performance and literary arts,~and the work of contemporary critics, Carroll~provides a charming, erudite and persuasive argument that evaluation of art~is an indispensable part of the conversation of life.},

By last Sunday morning, one of the Internet's most popular downloads was the hours-old 60-second .wmv file of Ashlee Simpson on ''Saturday Night Live.'' As she and her band stood onstage, her own prerecorded vocals -- from the wrong song -- came blaring through the speakers, and it was too late to start mouthing the words. So she performed a now-infamous little jig, then skulked offstage, while the band (were a few members smirking?) played on. One of 2004's most popular new stars had been exposed as.      As what, exactly? The online verdict came fast and harsh, the way online verdicts usually do. A typical post on her Web site bore the headline, ''Ashlee you are a no talent fraud!'' After that night, everyone knew that Jessica Simpson's telegenic sister was no rock 'n' roll hero -- she wasn't even a rock 'n' roll also-ran. She was merely a lip-synching pop star.},

The results indicate that poeple's reports are highly inaccurate. Stimulus components with substantial effects on responses were reported to have had no effect on responses, and stimulus components with little or no effect were reported to have had substantial effects. The results indicate that research which relies on people's introspective reports about the causes of their behavior may have little value as a guide to the true causal influences.},
