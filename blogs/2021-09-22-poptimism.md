Adolph Reed describes *ideology* as "the mechanism that harmonizes the principles that you want to believe you hold, with what advances your material interests" [@taibbiInterviewProfessorAdolph2021]. In this conception, ideology is a form of *confabulation*: the creation *ex nihilo* of some belief, memory, desire, etc. for the sake of explaining or justifying one's behavior [cf. @bergamaschiganapiniConfabulatingReasons2020]. In a famous study, for example, subjects were acted to pick their favorite among a selection of nylon socks [@wilsonAccuracyVerbalReports1978]. They were then asked why they chose the pair of socks they had and offered various accounts of the superiority of their preferred pair. In fact, the socks were all identical: the subjects' stated reasons for their choice could not have been their actual reasons. Rather, these beliefs were confabulations.

# Poptimism

In the early 2000s, music critics decided that pop music could be, in fact, cool [@sannehRapRockism2004; @gormelyTaylorSwiftLeads2014]. In part, this was responding to indie-pop musicians --- The Knife, Robyn, Bj√∂rk --- who are, in fact, cool. What we are interested in, though, is music critic's newfound reverence of pop stars proper --- Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Arianna Grande, etc. --- an attitude that gets called *poptimism*. 

The commentariat had a little conniption over the rise of poptimism in the mid 2010s. This stuff [e.g. @austerlitzPerniciousRisePoptimism2014; @johnstonNewYorkTimes2014; @harvillaHaveWeReached2017; @richardsYouWantPoptimism2015] is enjoyably maddening to read. The joy and the madness stem from the same place: there is weightless drama here ("Poptimism bad!" "No, actually, you're bad!") unmoored from any concrete reality (What do we mean by pop music again? Where, exactly, is the poptimism happening?). Cultural phenomena are like clouds, more or less homogeneous distributions of water cast by the oddities of optics into striking but vague shapes. Like clouds, it is easy to see things in them.

# Interlude: Criticism

Here is what I see. Whether pop music deserves the critical attention given to it (it doesn't), and howsoever we delineate poptimism, there is a crushing material reality underlying this shift in music-critical ideology. Put simply, the critic is becoming obsolete. We can adduce three goods that the critic provides their reader [the book to read is @carrollCriticism2008].

1. Recommendation. We have only so much time and money to listen to music, read books, etc., such that we could use a trusty opinion about what is worth that time.
2. Appreciation. The critic can lead us to understand and appreciate a work more fully, especially where this work is more or less difficult.
3. Enjoyment. A well composed piece of criticism can be worth reading in itself.

In the case of music, modern conditions have blunted the attractiveness of the critic's offerings. The ubiquity and cheapness of music means that we don't have such a need for recommendations: a bad record only costs us a short time before we're onto the next thing. And other systems handle recommendations at the very least more conveniently. Streaming services will play an endless series of songs without our having to do anything. 

As a consequence of this, its all too easy to consume music in a passive, mindless way. It comes on in the background and we drive along to it, work and bop our heads, go for a jog, or do anything else other than sitting still and listening to it. If you do not even spend the time to properly listen to a piece of music, then there is little point to having someone explaining the intricacies of something that went in one ear and out the other.

That leaves the review as an artform in itself, something to be enjoyed on its own. This is a tricky needle to to thread. On the one side, a review can easily be a rote affair: it is a rather set genre. Experimentation within the genre however, can often yield pieces that cannot fairly be classified as reviews. (The on-hiatus [tinymixtapes](https://www.tinymixtapes.com/) has many examples of this latter category.) In the end, except rarely and in the hand of a gifted critic, the review itself is an object of typically minor aesthetic interest.

# Poptimism Again

If music criticism then is a genre in decline, what is a music critic to do? Here we might point to another genre dominated by pieces of marginal value, *clickbait*. The typical clickbait article takes a topic of significant extant interest and milks that interest for all of its worth, containing an easily digestible but information light body headed by a sensationalist title that rides like a parasite on already existing interest (*You won't believe what actor did to spouse*). Clickbait articles look like they offer basically nothing, but they in fact offer validation of the readers existing interests (*Hey, I care about what actor did to spouse*).

Criticism can offer the same shallow reassurance. Those interested in a piece of media can find their interest validated by criticism of that piece (and their opinion as well, if the critic shares it). As above, criticism can offer much more than that, but in a dire music culture such as ours the critic may well have to make do with this baseline level. And if that is the well one is looking to dig, one should incline towards what is already popular and validate the opinions of as many as possible (and further to echo the public's generally positive opinions). This is the basis of the critic's material interest in focusing on pop music. Of course this incentive has always existed, but given the changes outlined above other sources of rewards have faded.

And it is here where poptimism arises to "harmonize the principles that you want to believe you hold, with what advances your material interests." You, as a critic, want to believe that you are a fair judge. You devote your attention to the music that deserves attention and praise only what deserves to be praised. What advances your material interest is criticizing pop music. So, just convince yourself that pop music deserves attention, deserves praise, and bob's your uncle. Furthermore, when we are talking about a material interest that transcends the individual --- and this material interest is common to music critics as such --- this ideological alignment can happen not just by individuals changing their beliefs but by those individuals being replaced by holders of the new ideology. Those resisting poptivism may well find themselves becoming less relevant, less successful, while their poptivist colleagues are more successful in capturing criticism's dwindling marketplace.
