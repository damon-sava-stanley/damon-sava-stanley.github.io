# I. An Anatomy of Pessimism

| Inside the sinking whirl I think
|     What is art---
|     What is life---
|     What is space---
|     What is human---
| And who is a poet?
| I despise poets
| I asked where the function of trade for a poet lies
| And why do I have to write poetry?
| I rip up scrap paper without hesitation
| And have to pull it out and put it back together again
| Should I get in the door through the troubadours?
| Should I get in the door through the *Bohemians*?
| Rather than making useless scrap paper
| I can writhe like a beast
| My true friend said yesterday
| Just sing because you want to sing
| O, that should have been good enough
| Like a *Persian* poet
| If only the wine could brew itself and the heart and rose
| Were wings of poetry that could scatter with the wind ............
| Yesterday, to the words of a scholar
| If I could
| Just once
| Write a poem with a sincerely beautiful spirit.
|

In Lars von Trier's *Melancholia*, a rogue planet collides with the Earth. The
impact is preceded by general denial --- surely it could not happen ---
excepting the protagonist, Justine, who, by some unique faculty, just knows
that it will. This impact, however, merits no distress: "The Earth is evil,"
after all. The film's scenario is a pessimistic one: the Earth will soon
explode, and all of humanity's long-term projects will fail. But the film uses
that pessimistic scenario to express a deeper scenario: it is fine that
everything, our projects, our lives, come to nothing. They were not worth
anything to begin with. Our question for today is the following: is Justine
right? is the Earth evil?

We need to pause a moment, before we've even started, to clarify our terms.
Pessimism is an attitude towards a set of possible outcomes, in particular to
be pessimistic is to believe that the expected outcome is bad. It is rational
to be pessimistic towards the outcomes of a lottery: the likely outcome (your
ticket losing) is not good and the good outcome is not likely. What Justine is
expressing is not, however, pessimism towards some particular set of outcomes.
It is instead a global pessimism: when it comes to how things are going to go
*as a whole*, the prospects are not good.

There are a number of reasons you could believe this. The most straightforward
is simply to look at what sorts of things happen around here and to notice that
they've been largely pretty terrible and we don't have much reason to expect
that to change. Robert Burton in the *Anatomy of Melancholy* articulates
something like a defense of this form of pessimism.

> The heavens threaten us with their comets, stars, planets, with their great
> conjunctions, eclipses, oppositions, quartiles, and such unfriendly aspects.
> The air with his meteors, thunder and lightning, intemperate heat and cold,
> mighty winds, tempests, unseasonable weather; from which proceed dearth,
> famine, plague, and all sorts of epidemical diseases, consuming infinite
> myriads of men. At Cairo in Egypt, every third year, (as it is related by
> Boterus, and others) 300,000 die of the plague; and 200,000, in
> Constantinople, every fifth or seventh at the utmost. How doth the earth
> terrify and oppress us with terrible earthquakes, which are most frequent in
> China, Japan, and those eastern climes, swallowing up sometimes six cities at
> once? How doth the water rage with his inundations, irruptions, flinging down
> towns, cities, villages, bridges, &c. besides shipwrecks; whole islands are
> sometimes suddenly overwhelmed with all their inhabitants in Zealand,
> Holland, and many parts of the continent drowned, as the lake Erne in
> Ireland? *Nihilque praeter arcium cadavera patenti cernimus freto*. [And we
> perceive nothing, except the dead bodies of cities in the open sea.] In the
> fens of Friesland 1230, by reason of tempests, the sea drowned *multa hominum
> millia, et jumenta sine numero* [many thousands of men, and livestock without
> number], all the country almost, men and cattle in it. How doth the fire
> rage, that merciless element, consuming in an instant whole cities? What town
> of any antiquity or note hath not been once, again and again, by the fury of
> this merciless element, defaced, ruinated, and left desolate?

However plausible this empirically-minded pessimism is, it cannot be Justine's
attitude. For here the great conjunction of Melancholia and Earth is not any
sort of relief, but rather the final entry in a long, long list of calamities.
The claim that the Earth *is* evil, rather than merely visited by evil, is a
much stronger claim.

Indeed, Burton would accept that, in a certain sense, the Earth is good,
despite the overwhelming presence of natural evil. It is, after all, the
product of a perfectly good God who created it and called it good. Before the
Fall, there was no natural evil, and even afterwards all evil should be
understood as necessary. On this view, one can accept moral explanations of
natural phenomena. Why does the Earth exist as it does? Because it is good that
it does so.

This is a claim that is almost without exception (Derek Parfit) defended only
by theists. The standard view for atheists on this count then is, in the words
of Bertrand Russell (*Why I Am Not a Christian*), "that good and evil are ideas
which throw no light upon the nonhuman world. They might have some purchase in
the human and animal worlds, as there might be perfectly good explanations of
behavior that cite good and evil---St. Augustine stole a pear because it was
evil for him to do so---but certainly we don't need to, or further cannot
sensibly, appeal to anything like this in explaining the behavior of rocks or
galaxies.

A third possibility is that evil has genuine explanatory power in the nonhuman
realm. Why are there cockroaches? Simply because it is evil for there to be so.
This possibility, while it might be metal, is not particularly plausible.
Therefore, when we understand Justine's claim that the Earth is evil, we have
to understand it not as the claim that that what explains the state of the
world is evil. But it has to be something stronger than the claim that the
Earth is a place where evil happens to happen quite a lot. Here is, I think,
the most plausible and interesting version of this claim. Not only is the Earth
such that it is inhospitable, hostile, evil for us. We, humans, sapient beings,
are such that no Earth could be a home to us.

In the next section, I want to look at one way of elaborating this claim.

We're going to pause for and take a digression to cosmic horror and hence,
first, to H. P. Lovecraft. Call this the SEO-mandated section of the essay. To
give you a brief intro to Lovecraft's stories: the universe is filled with
spooky aliens and gods, most of them can kill you, some of them almost
certainly will kill you, but almost universally they're not malicious, just
indifferent to humanity. Often, merely learning about these spooky things is
enough to spook the sanity right out of you.

I'll return to one of those stories in a bit. For now, though, I want to talk
about some of Lovecraft's ideas. I need to credit S.T. Joshi's *H.P. Lovecraft:
The Decline of the West* as a valuable resource for this end. Here's
Lovecraft's presentation of his so-called "cosmicism" in a letter.

> What does it all amount to, anyway? In a few million years there will be no
> human race at all. Man, at best, is but an incident---and a very trifling
> incident---in the limitless history of Nature.... Planets are born, die, and
> are born again---and so on without end. It really makes one quite dizzy to
> think of such expanded matters!

Now, there are a couple of ways of understanding Lovecraft here. Either he's
merely reporting his own response to the scale of the universe, in which case
fair enough, or else he's intending to recommend this attitude: not merely that
he finds the existence of *homo sapiens* a trifling accident, but that this is
the correct way to think of that existence.

This latter interpretation is bold. It is not clear to what extent we
should think that something can be *really* trifling or *really* important, as
something over and above whether it happens to be found trifling or important.
Usually, we allow that something is important or unimportant only relative to
some end. If you intend to pass your introductory anthropology class, the
existence of *homo sapiens* is of some moment. Down the hall, in the abstract
algebra class, it is only of trivial interest that the results discussed were
come to by a certain species of hominid. We typically allow some degree of
freedom in setting one's own ends. 

Even if one thinks some ends especially choiceworthy (certain moral ends, for
example), it is not clear why those ends would be such that matters central to
human life turn out to be of no ultimate importance. It may be then that what
Lovecraft intends is to be endorsing nihilism: not only is the cosmos
indifferent to us in that good and evil do not figure into the explanation of
non-human (or, properly, non-sentient or non-sapient) goings on, but good and
evil themselves are empty concepts, illusions humans fashioned for one another.
(Indeed, he would later claim "No one thing, cosmically speaking, can be either
good or evil, beautiful or unbeautiful; for entity is simply entity." It is
unclear how one speaks cosmically or uncosmically, perhaps with sufficient
reverb.) As a corollary to this, no end would be worthier of choice than any
other and hence nothing would be important in some ultimate sense.

It, however, is a faulty inference to go from nothing being ultimately
important to everything being ultimately trifling. Rather, all we can say is
that things are important or trifling only according to one's ends, just as we
cannot say that anyone is ultimately a foreigner but someone is a foreigner or
a compatriot only according to one's nationality. If some things are *full
stop* important, the cosmicist owes us much more than she has ever given about
why humanity is not on the list. If nothing is important in that sense, then we
might as well prefer the following converse attitude, which is anyways a sight
cheerier.

> I admit I am so fashioned that I have only a resigned, and somewhat
> dismissive shrug for anything so super-impressive, so beyond all realization.
> Without doubt there is psychological pleasure in admiring greatness, in being
> enthusiastic about it, indeed in being overwhelmed by it, but that is only

I should mention that there's another way in which one can take Lovecraft's
remarks here. He may have merely in mind the following sort of thought. There
may be a list of the kinds of things that exist that are in some sense natural
or privileged. It's not clear in what sense, but we can say that there's
something funny about Borges' "Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge" that
is not funny about a periodic table of elements (at the least, the former is on
the walls of very few high-school classrooms). Lovecraft is a materialist, and
for the moment so are we, so nothing especially human, no souls, no vital
essences, is going to appear on the grand list of fundamentally existing
things. And similarly if you were to write the grand and supremely fair account
of every event that ever happened in the world, a miniscule portion would deal
with human affairs (particularly because, again, God does not exist and so we
figure not at all in the explanation of why the world got to be the way it is).
But that something takes up only a small proportion of an account that is in
some sense neutral, does not mean that is comparatively unimportant. One thing
can take up more space in such an account by being physically large, or
persisting for longer, but these are not in themselves features that make
something important.[^aside-naturalness]

[^aside-naturalness]: This discussion may have been partly opaque in detail to
    some readers. Those details are not crucial to the overall point that we
    should sharply distinguish the scale of some phenomena from its importance.
    Still, for the interested readers, in this aside I want to clarify these
    points.

    Let's start with a chicken on a farm. The chicken wakes up every morning.
    The sun is shining. The birds---the other birds---are singing. The farmer
    has laid out feed for the hen. She, to anthromorphize, thinks that things
    are always going to be as good as this. Sadly, she is mistaken. The farmer
    has a different plan: someday not too far off, the hen is to be
    slaughtered, plucked, cleaned, and hauled off to a supermarket.

    The hen thought she could predict the future. She thought incorrectly. But
    we also, in similar ways, try to predict the future. More generally we seem
    to expect that what we have not observed will be similar to what we have
    observed. This is what scientists expect when they draw grand theories
    (which are supposed to apply also to unobserved cases) from a body of
    experiments and observations. Similarly it's what we expect when we wait
    for the train to arrive at or at least sometime near the posted time. But
    it seems we don't have any argument showing we have any right to expect
    this. As the chicken example makes clear, we cannot be absolutely certain
    that the future will be as we expect, so there's not going to be any
    logical or conceptual demonstration showing the reasonableness of our
    expectation.

    Indeed, if we consider how the world would have to be to make reasoning in
    this way (drawing conclusions about the unobserved from the observed)
    reliable, we can see that it would be the uniformity of nature: that is
    that all of nature is self-similar. Patterns that hold in one part of
    nature (e.g. the observed) tend to hold in the rest (e.g. the unobserved).
    Why would we believe that? It seems the only thing we could really say is
    that, well, the parts of nature we have observed are uniform, so nature as
    a whole is uniform. But it would be objectionably circular to mount this
    defense.

    This is the problem of induction, brought home to us by Hume. The chicken
    example is Bertrand Russell's. I'm not here interested in diving deeper
    into the problem or examining solutions or dissolutions. Rather I want to
    use this problem to springboard into another discussion. Suppose you find a
    solution or a dissolution. You convince us that it's perfectly reasonable
    to believe that nature is uniform and so to engage in inductive reasoning
    is perfectly reasonable. Now you have another problem (courtesy of Nelson
    Goodman in *Fact, Forecast, and Fiction*).

    Think about our chicken again. She reasons in the following way. Here's
    something that's true about today, I'm not dead. Actually, this is true
    about yesterday, and the day before that, and then going hundreds of days
    in the past. So probably, that will keep being true. I won't die tomorrow.
    But here's another somewhat more peculiar way she could have reasoned.
    Here's another thing that's true about today: either it is before tomorrow
    and I am not dead, or it is at or after tomorrow and I am dead. Actually,
    this is true about yesterday and then going hundreds of days in the past.
    So, probably, that will keep being true. Tomorrow, I will die.

    So now we have two instances of the same pattern of reasoning, but with
    opposite conclusions. One of them has to be faulty. But why think that it's
    the second, funny-looking one that's suspect? That is what we want to say,
    but then we do have to say something about what it is to be funny-looking
    and why it's so bad anyway for an inductive argument to be funny-looking.

    Well, philosophers who want to defend science and common sense as not just
    parochial human practices but, actualy, good ideas, do have to give a
    theory of the funny-lookingness of inductive arguments. Here's a popular
    style of answer given by David Lewis: some properties or features of the
    world are special: they're *natural*. Somehow they "carve nature at its
    joints." What are some natural properties? Well, the basic physical
    properties are probably on the list: mass, charge, spin, etc.. Weird
    disjunctive properties, like being alive if it's before today or dead if
    it's after today, those are not going on the list. An inductive argument is
    funny-looking just in case it generalizes over these weird, unnatural
    properties.

    That's that. So when I talk about the grand, supremely fair account of the
    world, I mean the description of the world that only talks about natural
    properties. It will tell you, say, where all the particles are at in time
    and space. It will tell you what they're all up to. Here's what it won't
    tell you: where all the humans are at, what they're thinking, what's going
    up with them. Or at least, it will only tell you about them in the way that
    describing the particles I'm composed out of is a way of talking about me.
    And in this indirect way that we feature in this big book, we don't figure
    much at all.

    As I've tried to indicate, how much something figures in the big book is
    not a mark of importance. It's a mark of size.

Indeed, it should be noted that Lovecraft later came much to the same
conclusion when he later wrote "Each person ... [can] speak only for himself
when he calls this thing 'silly and irrelevant' and that thing 'vital and
significant,' as the case may be. We are all meaningless atoms adrift in the
void." It should be noted that the second sentence contradicts the first.

So much for cosmic insignificance. Let's now briefly turn to Lovecraft's
presentation of *indifferentism* which connects more clearly to our discussion
of pessimism.

> Contrary to what you may assume, I am *not a pessimist* but an
> *indifferentist*---that is, I don't make the mistake of thinking that the
> resultant of the natural forces surrounding and governing organic life will
> have any connexion with the wishes or tastes of any part of that organic
> lifeprocess. Pessimists are just as illogical as optimists; insomuch as both

> which gives a damn one way or the other about the especial wants and ultimate
> welfare of mosquitoes, rats, lice, dogs, men, horses, pterodactyls, trees,
> fungi, dodos, or other forms of biological energy.

As far as I can tell, though, Lovecraft is using "optimist" and "pessimist" in
a peculiarly restricted sense. In particular, those we would usually consider
pessimists don't in general conceive of the aims of mankind as unified. So, for
example, Schopenhauer, who Lovecraft on occasion cites, thought that existence
is suffering (as suffering is the hindrance, for Schopenhauer, of will and
forces and organisms strive and hinder one another and throw up always new ends
so "there is no measure and end of suffering," *World as Will and
Representation* 56). Schopenhauer's story here assumes on the contrary a
disunity of mankind's ends: it is precisely because of the disunity of our ends that the "inevitable flow of terrestrial motivation and events" will disappoint them.
