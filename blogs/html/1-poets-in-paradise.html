<p>What is the role of poets in paradise? Put this way, the question sounds odd: overwrought, perhaps, indulgent. We are not inclined to take paradise seriously and less inclined to extend such conceit to poetry. There is much to be said for this dismissive attitude and some of it will be said subsequently. For now I want to take the question seriously. Certainly, it is a question that poets themselves have taken seriously. Henry Vaughan in “To the River Isca” writes of “<em>Poets</em> (Like <em>Angels</em>)” who pass “To <em>Meadows</em> strow’d with <em>Lillies</em> and the <em>Rose</em> / And <em>shades</em> whose <em>youthful green</em> no <em>old age</em> knowes.” Vaughan as poet and hence, in this mood, as ally of beauty and truth will leave “such a *large, kind light,** / As shall redeem thee from <em>oblivious night</em>“. The poets here are what makes paradise paradise”Where all in <em>white</em> they walk, discourse, and Sing / Like Bees <em>soft murmurs</em>, or a <em>Chiding Spring</em>&quot; what with their “<em>Garlands</em>, and <em>Songs</em>, and <em>Roundelayes</em>.” But more than the artists of paradise, the poets as “<em>shades Proheticall</em>” are guides towards this paradise even if they are also, as Dante’s Virgil, guides through (and hence out of) hell. This is the most that can be possibly be pretended for the paradisical poet: she, as creator of beauty, makes paradise and she, as custodian of truth, knows how to get us there.</p>
<p>Doubts immediately set in from all sides. Let us start with an ancient worry: is the domain of the poet, her beauty and her truth, anything more than the sensual world, with its roses and lillies and songs? But is it not also the case, Plato remarks in the <em>Phaedo</em>, “as the poets are always dinning into our ears, that we neither hear nor see anything accurately?” (65) Think of the sirens; it is not clear why we should trust that Vaughan’s “large, kind light” illuminates what it is we need to see. This ancient skepticism may be paired with a more modern cynicism: even if the poets had such a light, as a matter of fact no one would follow it. No one even reads poetry anymore, really, if they do not have to. These two challenges form a sort of Scylla and Charbydis: one the one hand poetry has no hopes of exerting any influence and even if it did this influence would be a negative one. After all, when Rothenberg in the quoted “Paradise of Poets” imagines the power of the poet, it is an apocalyptic power, the power to declare oneself the final one.</p>
<p>I believe these challenges to be considerable. In the face of them, we cannot maintain a conception of the poet as redemptive figure. Nevertheless, the destruction is not total. In the first and second section I sketch the modern and then the ancient challenges to the positive ethical potential of poetry. In the final section</p>
