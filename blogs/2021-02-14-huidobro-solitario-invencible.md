title: "Vincente Huidobro: Solitario invencible"
...

I've been occasionally pecking away some of the work of Vincente Huidobro. I have long since lost my never-good Spanish and have engaged in very amateur translations in a half-hearted effort to return it to its former half-luster. The are three versions of the translation here: a straightforward, unpoetic, line-by-line translation; a condensed, more poetic version; and then a complete reworking. In general, I think an effective translation requires someone much more fluent, much more attuned to the context and features of the original. So this is not really a translation but a writing-through.

# Solitario invencible

| Resbalando
| Como canasta de amarguras
| Con mucho silencio y mucha luz
| Dormido de hielos
| Te vas y vuelves a ti mismo
| Te ríes de tu propio sueño
| Pero suspiras poemas temblorosos
| Y te convences de alguna esperanza
| 
| La ausencia el hambre de callar
| De no emitir más tantas hipótesis
| De cerrar las heridas habladoras
| Te da una ansia especial
| Como de nieve y fuego
| Quieres volver los ojos a la vida
| Tragarte el universo entero
| Esos campos de estrellas
| Se te van de la mano después de la catástrofe
| Cuando el perfume de los claveles
| Gira en torno de su eje

# Solitary invincible

| Sliding
| As a basket of bitterness
| With much silence and much light
| Sleeping on ice
| You go and return to yourself
| You laugh at your own dream
| But sigh at trembling poems
| And convince yourself of another hope
| 
| The absence of street hunger
| To not give off so many hypotheses
| To close the chatty wounds
| Gives you a special craving
| Like that of snow and fire
| You want to return the eyes to the life
| That swallows the universe whole
| Those fields of stars
| Leave the hand after the catastrophe
| When the perfume of the carnations
| Turns the lathe on its axis

# Solitary Invincible

| Sliding,
| You leave and return.
| You laugh at your dreams
| But sigh at poems.
| 
| Closing the chatty wounds
| Arouses a special desire:
| You want to resurrect those
| Eyes that swallow the whole
| Universe. After the catastrophe,
| The carnations' perfume turns
| The lathe on its axis.

# Alone Deathless

| You leave a dream journal atop
| my book of poems, and a page flutters
| from one or other. *“After catastrophe,”*
| *a wound says, “carnations turn*
| *the lathe on its axis.”* 

# Comments

In the original, there is this wonderful movement from what feels almost like a domestic situation to a surreal apocalypse. I have interpolated a relationship between the speaker and the addressed: it is not made explicit, but the tone and general romanticism suggests it. There is another movement too, from language and reason to feeling: to not "give so many hypotheses" or "close the chatty wounds." The signs of catastrophe, the surfacing of deep feeling, are laughable dreams or pathetic emotion. The aim of my versions has been to condense the poem to just what is required for those parallel movements.
